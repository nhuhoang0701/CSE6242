As far as Utah goes, is there any special emotional motivation to beat them or are they just another team in the conference?  

I would love to have that confidence that you will just beat Utah.  They really aren’t that great of a team if you can not fall into the trap of playing their game.  They live, literally LIVE on luck and forcing weird turnovers or as my brother calls it “unearned rewards”... if you can force them to play the game they don’t want to play and make their QB win it for them, you win.  That’s brilliant!  The 3-3-5 is all about deception and pressure.  It generally isn’t know for stopping the run.  How are you able to do it so effectively against a team that historically has excellent running backs?  Because another key to beating Utah is taking away the run game.  When you make them actually have to play football, they become very average.

So if I’m understanding this correctly, the key to beating Utah like a Sun Devil is to:

1. Shut down the run game
2. Force them to win with their QB
3. Capitalize on the errors that their QB will inevitably make

4. Enjoy the win.

Is it just that easy?

Finally, UNRB and Utah fans are actually very similar in many ways when you put it like that.  It’s a very enigmatic phenomenon when you combine variables such as pride, frustration, arrogance, ignorance, and little results into a culture with an identity, logo, and institution and you get a very unusual outcome.

It’s interesting to me because ASU hasn’t been wildly successful and yet my visits to Tempe have been nothing like that at all.  Just chill, cool, nice people trying to have a good time.

It’s fascinating to compare the differences between UA and ASU.  Two completely different cultures and fan bases living in the same state.  Ones friendly and open, the other is mean and exclusivist.  I’m fascinated, genuinely fascinated.",0.4041,0.4074,0.1885
Arizona,"&gt;Does that even make sense?

Yea my general interaction with UA alumni is that they went to UA so they didn't have to go to ASU if that makes sense, so there's all this sense of identity wrapped up in being better than.....\*insert\*. whereas ASU thanks to its ""accept literally everyone"" admissions policy kind of grounds you.

&gt;Would you say ASU fans are happy with  where the program is?  And by that I mean, that they are cool with  playing the underdog card and just going out and having a good time?

I would say so, there's an interesting dynamic at ASU where you have the Anti- and Pro-Michael Crow (our current president and the guy responsible for the whole new american university and #1 in innovation and all that) crowds. The Anti-MC crowd (who are usually older alumni and phoenix metro area natives)tend to want ASU to act like a traditional university, so those people tend to be less happy when the football team doesn't have success, the admissions policy, the #1 in innovation thing. Whereas the Pro-Michael Crow crowd (which is vastly larger for obvious reasons and tends to be younger out of arizona transplants) embraces the good natured fun. Like Firm for Herm was the most fun I've had with ASU football since Bercovici's hail mary over USC.",0.5995,0.3505,0.05

Arizona,"1)  Yes, we run the 3-3-5.  Coach Herm made some mention about the quality and quantity of DBs we seem to have this year, and that they need to find a way to utilize that.  Which probably means we'll see some new coverages this year.  Still 335, but with a wrinkle or two.

2)  With Utah, it has often come down to playing decent run defense, and forcing their QB to make plays.  Some years it's better run defense, some years we get to the QB and force errors or an injury.  Utah's achilles heel is quarterback play.  It's never been great.  Sometimes that's on the revolving door at OC, but sometimes it's the player.

3)  I think we beat Utah.  I always think we'll beat Utah.  I've been right 6 out of 8 times.  That said, I don't expect to win the South.  I worry about our depth and inexperience at QB.  Just a few injuries could make for a rough year.  I'm guessing 2nd place in the PAC south, but I'm not sure at all about that.

4)  UNRB (University of No Rose Bowls) fans are an enigma.  A trashy, unkempt, odorous enigma.  Part of it is the chip on the shoulder every Tucson resident has or develops.  They aren't Phoenix, say they don't want to be, but secretly hate that they aren't.  Part of it is also the misery of so many bad seasons and regimes.  They're beaten down and think they should be much further along as a program.  It's the biggest small town in America.  The world's largest Truckstop.  It's...Tucson.",0.0306,0.2476,0.7218
Arizona,"Fantastic response and insight.  Thank you.  The 3-3-5 was awesome when Bronco Mendenhall came over from New Mexico to BYU.  We just didn’t have the athletes in the secondary to be able to effectively execute it so we had to scrap it after a few years.  How do ASU fans like it?  Have you been pretty happy with it and Gonzales?

That was some awesome insight about ASUs culture and atmosphere.  I think when you have a ND/USC/UCLA kind of history, it creates that expectation of how things are “supposed to be”...

There was this whole insecurity vibe with UA fans that was quite unusual to me.  Like, an attitude of superiority because they belonged to a p5 conf but the knowledge that their performance as a program has been generally abysmal and their program mostly irrelevant.  So when a team like BYU comes to visit, it was like an explosion of that dynamism (frustration/apathy + arrogance/exclusivity) directed at a supposed lesser G5 program.  UA fans also just seemed kind of miserable and angry overall.  They know what success looks like based on their success in b-ball but just couldn’t ever seem to consistently put it together in football.  Regardless, the whole attitude of a lot of their fans was, lol it’s hard to describe it because it was so unusual and paradoxical, but yeah, it was so sad and self loathing while at the same time, it was drenched in a sense of False/cheap pride.  Does that even make sense?

I also know people can get pretty riled up about Mormons if you live in a high Mormon population community but aren’t Mormon yourself.  It’s perplexing to me but I guess I can say I understand the logic behind the behavior.  Being from Portland myself, I was oblivious at the animosity brewing out there within that conflictual realm of religion and society.  Never the less it was still pretty shocking.

Arizona,"1.We ran it last year and I'm unaware of any plans to change from the 3-3-5

2.I think its one of those statistical anomalies at this point that may just be giving a psychological edge, that being said perhaps Erickson figured out some killer sauce about Whittingham and passed it to Graham who passed it to Herm. Also don't discount ""cold weather"" teams being unprepared for the heat when they come to Tempe. Average temp in salt lack is like 65 in the fall whereas its 85 in Tempe. 

3.ASU has been pretty adept at playing this weird Berserker spoiler role, so whilst on paper Utah seems like the no brainer I'm pretty happy with our chances based on meme potential alone. 

4.Tempe is just a great place to live, Tucson, not so much, plus its hard to be unhappy at Sun Devil stadium when you've got Mill right there and everyones pretty lit because its hot as balls. Plus ASU's up and down nature breeds for a pretty carefee fandom experience. In my personal opinion we aren't some great dynasty of yesteryear who can't live up to expectations (UCLA, USC, Notre Dame) so you don't have any preconceived notions of what the team is ""supposed"" to do. You're never really surprised if you win or lose so its hard to get upset either way. 

If I had to speculate on the difference between the two (other than standard rivalry stuff) I'd say that Tempe/Phoenix is a much nicer area than Tucson and that allows for a much more carefree outlook.

But that's only for black and white; color is $0.50 per page at ASU, so at 80 pages of color it's more worth it. The key thing to remember is that the printer is not where the main cost is. Toner cartridges are far more expensive than the printer itself. They last a couple thousand pages usually, but you can easily pay more for a single toner cartridge than you paid for the printer.

Bottom line, it's up to how you want to do it. I think in the long run, ASU printing is cheaper unless you want to do a lot of printing, but buying your own printer is more convenient because you never need to worry about it being used by someone else.

I may be biased as hell, but I believe that Cassidy’s students are among the best. If you are unable to find any groups with Shields, go find some with Cassidy. 

Intermediate accounting is the make or break class for accounting students - you either rise to the occasion or blow up. Quite frankly, there is A LOT of material to cover. Just don’t get lost and don’t slow down - you will make it.

People I know have taken 340 with the same amount of credits that you’re thinking of, and they got As. Some have taken 21+ credits and were involved in clubs, and they also got As. 

The best way to study 340, in my opinion, is to learn and review everything. Learn chapter 1. Then, after you learn chapter 2, re read and retest yourself on chapter 1. Then go forward. It will help you so much in the long run.

BCH461 was much better since he emphasized concepts, though there's still a bit of memorization involved in biochem.

Arizona,"Hey, I understand that this is likely confusing. As a biochemistry major, I took 461, 462, and 341.

341 has next to no relevance on the MCAT. It’s physical chemistry, and some sorts of problems or information you cover in the class *might* appear on the MCAT, but you are going to cover that material in other classes.

If you choose the 461 -462 route, you need to take both of them. 361 is a combination of those two classes into one semester. As a result, it does not go into the same level of detail. However, most of the high yield biochemistry topics appear in 462, and you will not be prepared for the MCAT if you just take 461.

361 should be all you need for the MCAT biochemistry parte. The MCAT does not go into that much detail in biochemistry. If anything, I’d recommend that you take 361 unless you need the 461 and 462 route for your major. 461 and 462 go heavily into the types of details that are too deep for the MCAT exam.

Arizona,"I never had a real issue with WiFi in the dorms or most places on campus. If it seems spotty, you should register for the secure network because I found it had a better connection than the regular WiFi in the few places that weren't constant.Regarding your question of routers, this is from the [Residential Computing](https://housing.asu.edu/housing-resources/housing-technology-center/residential-computing) page:

&gt;Residential Computing network services and wiring may not be modified or extended beyond the area of their intended use. This applies to all network wiring, hardware, in-room jacks and extension of such via wireless hub/switch devices. The use of a personal wireless access point (aka. Wireless Router) in a residential room is prohibited. However, the use of an Ethernet switch to connected multiple computing devices is highly encouraged. The residential network may not be used to provide ASU network or Internet access to anyone outside of the university.

Tl;dr: no routers. But you can bring a switch (a standalone switch; not a SOHO router) to extend hardwired connection. I recommend abiding by these rules, because you don't want to be on IT's bad side as a rule of thumb.

Also, try to score the highest you can the first time around. It’ll save you money (the test is around $300), time, and any potential discrimination adcoms might have against MCAT retailers.

I prepared hard for a week before the mid terms. I went through all (and by all I mean each and every question and their solutions in detail) past papers and homeworks of Dr. Colbourn and made sure I knew how to solve them. I attempted them myself first to get the hang of it and then checked with the solutions. For the week before mid terms I spend roughly 3 hours every day.

End terms are a whole new thing. Past papers are not available so I attempted all of Sipser's questions. Ryan Dougherty has solutions posted to several questions so that helped.

Dr. Colbourn's exams are long. If you stop to think and are confused about a concept, trust me you wouldn't be able to complete the paper. All your concepts should be rock solid.

Database management is huge money. Security is getting bigger every year. While application development isn't the specific goal of this program, I've had several job offers in development and did some work for companies while in the program. But I took the time and effort to make that happen. 

If your goal is strictly programming and program development CS is probably the better program for that. But there's more to IT than just making programs and that's what IFT does. You will still get some coding experience in Java or Python... enough to understand how to move forward... but it's all what you make of it.",0.5439,0.4071,0.049

&amp;nbsp;

The problem is after a point, the garages go permit only because they're ALWAYS oversold and at a certain occupancy they need to cut off visitors.  Those people then overflow to the lots on the edges of campus.  This doesn't last all semester, people settle into an ebb and flow and things settle down a bit but for the first few weeks parking is pretty hit or miss on whether you'll be able to find something within 10-15 min; this isn't a shopping mall, people tend to stay all day or at least until their last class and with tons of welcome events going on...",0.0533,0.3167,0.63

You're honestly better off going to a park and ride and taking the light rail in, at least for the first few weeks and until you get your on-campus routes and haunts scouted.

If you still have one meal swipe left for the day, you can use it at the Pod and/or Tooker. I don’t think you can do two meal exchanges in one day. 

Not exactly sure on how you exchange it because I never bothered doing so, but I’m assuming you go to the section for meal exchanges (it will be labeled) and what you could get and go up to the register and they’ll swipe your card.

Arizona,"How early - shoot for 15 minutes early on the first day at least. That way you can get a decent seat and not miss your class. Note, some people stick to the same seat the whole semester so getting a good seat the first few classes is kinda important 

Room size - depends on the class size. Some classes are lecture halls, others are small 15-20 person rooms

Best position - up front if you want to pay attention and do well in class but NOTE you have a higher chance of being called out by your professor. In the back of the room, you can get away with doing other hw/ studying for another class if that’s how you wanna spend your time

Teachers on the first day - syllabus day. They go over the syllabus and what they expect from you. Some do ice breakers (*yeah*....). Some head straight into the material. The more difficult the course, the more likely the prof will get started with the course work on the first day

Other things to watch out for as a newbie - don’t stress man. It’s not as bad as you think it is. But here’s some advice that new people need to hear : go to office hours, go seek tutoring when you need it, go to clubs and orgs (ya, go to passport August 21!) - club and org leadership positions are great on a resume soooo stick with it and apply to do them, if you see something you wanna do — like a school event like petting dogs during exam week GO DO IT, attend career fairs, network network network (join a career oriented club and schmooze up and befriend your campus recruiters, not even lying homie, that’s how you’ll get a job)

Arizona,"Make sure you can get a job with it. I'm not sure how many undergrad jobs there are in your field but that's why I left my first major. It won't change anything financially but if you have a goal company then it gives good motivation, also if you know you can land a good job than a little debt isn't going to kill you.

Also easy income can be found on campus so look at jobs like the front desk of residence halls. You'll be able to study and get some cash.

Arizona,"I used a standard 1/4”-ish cable lock on my first pos bike (‘twas free, but I had completely cleaned and relubed the chain and wheel bearings) and I used it for about two months before someone cut the cable and took it in the middle of the school day (1PM-ish).

Used a Kyptonite New York u-lock that cost as much as the new bike and I still have it today (3+ years).

Lockpickinglawyer on YouTube is a good way of deciding on a lock. Focus on destructive methods of defeating locks and not so much picking. Most petty thieves are going to cut and go or use a leverage attack. 

[LPL destructive entry playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpIvUbO_777weU0UyeczsnFmq-hbdH-0b) 

I have a friend who is grounds maintenance for a public facility in Phoenix and a licensed locksmith who has to often remove bikes secured in unauthorized areas. Before he learned to pick locks he just destroyed them, so again, that is our main concern. However, this shows another point: do NOT secure your bike to fences or in areas your are told not to by signage. It will be removed and usually quickly.

On that note, if you need a new bike, you can buy a confinscated one here from ASU:

If you don't have a degree in CSE or a similar field it's definitely going to be iffy at best to seem like you ""know the material"" without having real projects and something to show from it. If you're trying to do those courses without the degree ASU makes you take prerequisites and at best I think you would need 4/5 semesters just to be able to take some of those upper courses. (CSE110-&gt;205-&gt;220/240-&gt;310-&gt;onward I believe, but I think these may have other reqs anyway.) In my opinion if you're spending 2/3 years even just part time, just get a degree in CSE or something similar.

I have a few udemy courses that I use as quickish reference guides when needed and project starters/ideas and one has the same if not more material than CSE110/205 and I got that for maybe $12. (Always search for a promo code.) I would NOT recommend college courses just in coding without actually having the intent on the degree. Unless you're going to CC for some.

For example, if we said the time quanta was 1 second B would have gotten done at 59s. If we said the time quanta was .1s B would have finished at 59.9s. This value approachs 60s for an infinity small time quanta. This was the value to use for B in the calculations/ to figure out other associated values.

Plugged it into the coax in our dorms and worked like a charm. 

Then we took Cat5 cable and ran it inside the AC vents between our suites. Boom, we made a private network for us and close friends for movies, music and Xbox 360 games for my modded Xbox. That private network was more reliable than the ASU internet. I also had Rapiddownload to pirate on the ASU network. (Http downloads) If the ASU internet went out, we'd have half a dozen people in the room turning in homework before the deadlines. 

I had 2 ethernet jacks on my computer one went to our private network and the other went to the school network. I'd just turn off each ethernet card for the task I was going to do.

Arizona,"The short answer is that students commit a lot more crime against students than homeless people do.

The most common crime is nonviolent theft, and that’s pretty high on the Tempe campus. Tempe is an attractive target for every kind of theft because it has a lot of people who aren’t very careful. Downtown students aren’t “smarter,” but Downtown is a less attractive target for crimes of opportunity.

Violent crimes tend to take place between people who know each other, or they are crimes of opportunity. Homeless folks don’t attack students because, well, they don’t have a reason to do so. Robbery might be an exception, but there are much easier targets around (usually other homeless people). Tempe is full of places like parking garages and poorly lit pathways that make for potential robbery sites.

There is also the issues of policing. Downtown is really compact compared to Tempe. Most of the buildings have an ASU PD person or a security person at the front. There are a few spaces where ASU PD and Phoenix PD have nearly overlapping jurisdictions. There are more events in the Downtown area than in Tempe (think of every DBacks or Suns game) that increases police presence nearby.

As a last bit, homelessness is not always sign of crime. The homeless populations downtown rose due to a combination of closing shelters, the dismal amount of money Phoenix and Arizona spend on support for poor people, and the mass replacement of affordable housing with expensive condos.",0.0497,0.3526,0.5978

Arizona,"Okay so I actually got into metal from an interest in the hard rock of the 80s and 90s, so Metallica and Megadeath are my favorites of the big four. Personally, I'm more into the 90s grunge sound, but as mentioned in [an earlier comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASU/comments/cru2bn/any_metal_heads_at_asu/exdm2c2/) my favorite subgenres are symphonic (**Epica**, **Whyzdom**, **Beyond the Black**, **Delain**, **Eleine**, **Graveshadow**), gothic (Evanescence, **Legenda Aurea**, **Elysion**) heavy/alternative (System of a Down, Pantera, Rage Against the Machine, Slipknot, Avenged Sevenfold, **Godsmack**, **Alter Bridge**, **Halestorm**, **Priestess**, **Flyleaf**), sludge (Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Nirvana, Black Sabbath, **Mastodon**), industrial/prog (Tool, Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson, Black Flag, **Primus**), and a bit of power metal (Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Powerwolf, **DragonForce**, **Sabaton**). (I bolded lesser-known acts if you want to get deep into the respective genres.)

One thing you'll learn very quickly though is that metal genres are very fluid. It's hard to organize all the above bands into one specific subgenre, and many belong in more than one. (Honestly I might catch a bit of flack for how loose I was with even labelling certain bands as metal, haha.) I'm also very into metal bands with female leads, which is reflected in my preference for symphonic and gothic metal. As you can tell by this list (which basically ended up being a list of every metal band I listen to lol) I'm still somewhat into more popular bands and haven't branched out much yet, but I'm sure you'll find your niche too. \^.^

&gt;  A strong understanding of your learning style is obviously required.

I would also agree that I should've given more credence to the fact that OP is a freshman. From what I saw as a freshman I agree with you that many treated it as high school and suffered because of that perception. 

Given all of this, I'd like to proposed a revised idea for OP:

&gt;When you start college, you go to every class, without exception. You do this until you understand your learning style. If you find that you do not benefit from certain lecturers, and can get the information outside of the classroom, there's little reason to attend lectures. I must stress, however, that the presence of mind to discern which lectures are worth attending, is a skill that you most likely won't attain until **at least** the end of your sophomore year. Even that timeline is pushing it.   
&gt;  
&gt;You may also find, that the due diligence to get the education outside the lecture is more time consuming than actively attending the lectures. In my experience, the effort was worth it. I found that method of learning far more satisfying than sitting through lectures.  
&gt;

Arizona,"Tempe focuses mainly on theory in your classes, with some electives and higher-level classes having practical labs, but still labs that are run by TAs that you just number crunch on. To get real hands-on experience designing/building stuff you need to join an engineering club, of which there are plenty, like Formula SAE/Formula Electric, SAE Aero, SAE Baja, Daedelus, SDSL, NASA Space Grant Robotics, several other rocketry clubs I can't remember the names of, Hyperloop, etc. You get what you put into these clubs, but they can be very rewarding, since you're putting the theory into practical use. 


I only spent a semester at Poly, but from researching the courses and taking some of them, it's very technical, hands-on, and project based, with focus on theory kept to the essentials. In your classes you get to design and build a lot more than Tempe, and Poly has more labs/workspaces/equipment for students on-site. You should still join an engineering club if you can/want to, but you can get a lot of the hands-on experience from classes.

Additionally, the thesis experience can provide material for a compelling statement. 


Lastly, references from your committee members (who can address your research capabilities) are very valuable.

Despite what the social media mob latched onto, the issue was never about the price of required access codes; that's a problem at every university and is by no means unique to ASU or the Econ Department. The issue was the alleged quid pro quo between ASU and Pearson, which no one - among Goegan, the investigation, and everyone else - ever presented any actual evidence for (except for hearsay).

The big draw of Pearson is that it makes it *a lot* easier to standardize content across all sections of the course, without having to coordinate among all the individual instructors and trying to enforce those standards throughout the year. At the end of the day, those 200-level intro courses are probably the lowest thing on the department's priority list (behind research, grad classes, and major-specific classes) so the convenience of using Pearson's content is going to take priority over the drawbacks, just like it does in numerous other departments in numerous other universities.",0.3478,0.5023,0.1499

2. That companies were paying ASU to require their software...which again was never proven.

ASU isn't failing people to make the online codes more necessary and it isn't making money by making us buy those codes...as far as we can tell.

That being said, Dr. Gould's hybrid CHM 233 class will not appear any differently on your official transcript than an in-person class. The only way a medical school would ever find out about it is if you put the course format somewhere in your application or essay. Even then, I wouldn't worry about it. I can't find the specific email, but Dr. Gould specifically stated that this class meets the requirements for medical schools because the ""two classes will share the same website, lectures and all class materials.""

If you're really that worried about it, I would attend all the lectures in person. In that way, you could honestly say that the class was not online. Most medical schools seem to be worried about pre-requisite labs anyway, and CHM 237 is obviously in-person only.

""Students aspiring to medical school who took key prerequisite courses online are often ineligible to apply to the postgraduate programs they might otherwise choose -- and despite the growth in mainstream acceptance of online programs, the status quo looks unlikely to change soon.

Stanford University School of Medicine’s admissions requirements state that “online course work and degrees will not be considered.” The same goes for the Johns Hopkins University and University of Pittsburgh Schools of Medicine.

Harvard Medical School has “no specific policy” but requires that student applicants secure approval from the admissions office for online courses “on a case-by-case basis”; the same is True at Weill Cornell Medicine. Morehouse School of Medicine accepts students who took online math courses but not online science courses. Numerous other institutions don’t specify their policies around online courses on their admissions webpages.""",0.0633,0.5121,0.4246

Every Friday at ~5AM you had ~50 students in our Business Building Study Lounge/Cafeteria, trying to make sure their homework was correct.  Worked out well for me because I worked at a bar that had $1.50 domestic beers and $2.75 import/craft beer every Thursday night, so I'd get out of work at ~4am and go straight to the Caf...

Arizona,"**Nazi Party**

The National Socialist German Workers' Party (German: Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei , abbreviated NSDAP), commonly referred to in English as the Nazi Party (English: ), was a far-right political party in Germany that was active between 1920 and 1945, that created and supported the ideology of National Socialism. Its precursor, the German Workers' Party (Deutsche Arbeiterpartei; DAP), existed from 1919 to 1920.



The Nazi Party emerged from the German nationalist, racist and populist Freikorps paramilitary culture, which fought against the communist uprisings in post-World War I Germany. The party was created to draw workers away from communism and into völkisch nationalism.

Arizona,"On the ""national socialist party is the Nazis"" comment, that is a massive straw man because the party was not socialist at all and was named that to entice uninformed workers to join the party which was actually far right and anti communist.

* The National Socialist German Workers' Party, commonly referred to in English as the Nazi Party (English: /ˈnɑːtsi, ˈnætsi/), was a **far-right political party** in Germany.[1]
* The Nazi Party emerged from the German nationalist, racist and populist Freikorps paramilitary culture, which **fought against the communist uprisings** in post-World War I Germany.[2]
* The party was created to **draw workers away from communism** and into völkisch nationalism.[3]

On the ""Lenin consistently declared that the goal of socialism is communism"" comment, that has absolutely no relevance to the original comment about what the CCP stands for and also has no relevance on whether communism is good or bad.

Arizona,"First off, this isn't high school so they're not ""teachers"", they're lecturers, professors, or instructors.  

&amp;nbsp;


The acoustics of some lecture halls are such that while the lecturer can project out with little effort, very few crowd noises make their way back to the front.  If I didn't know a few things about how this is accomplished, I'd probably think it's black fucking magic.  That being said, it's entirely plausible that your lecturer is unaware of just how disruptive their little matinee is.  

&amp;nbsp;

If you're not comfortable confronting people politely (it's a learned skill so really, there's no better time to practice than now) then you may want to write the lecturer and let him know that the idle chatter is distracting to the point that you literally cannot hear the material and its disrupting your ability to learn and take accurate notes.  However, don't be surprised if he tells you to handle it yourself or move.

3. He had a class dedicated to solely hand out exams (not in alphabetical order) after every exam. Once you got your exam you were allowed to leave but since it was never in alphabetical order it sucked if you were last. 
4. Top 35% of the class gets an obligatory A, next 35% gets a B, the next a C and so on...
5. His exams are literally the same example he'd do in class but with different numbers.

The good thing about Google drive is that whenever you use anything on there like a document or PowerPoint if you go to the right hand side you can just pull up the calendar to see what's up or you can also pull up a thing called tasks where you can just put a list of everything you have to do, which is what I started doing.

430 E University Dr #1234, Tempe, AZ 85281

2. Make sure it’s all typed in correctly

3. PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU YOUR FIRST AND ESPECIALLY LAST NAME ARE ON THE ADDRESS

Sign in using your ASU email and it’ll tell you if you have any packages and how many. Exit out and proceed to go to the counter or grab the attention of someone behind the counter.

If alpha particles stop hitting the detector, then the alarm is triggered. This is intended to be caused by smoke particles scattering the alpha particles, i.e. the smoke particles get in the path of the alpha particles, a collision happens, and the alpha particle is sent off in a different direction. Steam can very easily trigger the same response as smoke, and dust can as well if enough gets in and you have a sensitive enough smoke detector.

Long story short: it is very possible for steam from a hot shower or humidifier to set off a smoke detector. The farther away the steam source is from the smoke detector, the less likely it is that this will happen.

They start, do like two or three names, and then change tasks suddenly by asking the student a personal question (""what is something your parents taught you that you now find morally or ethically questionable""). Based on that student's answer (let's say ""they taught me I could be anything I want to be, which I now know is unTrue cuz I'm 5' so clearly I can't be an NBA starter"") theyll get excited, tell a personal story, then separate us into groups by birthdate or color of shoes or something, then have us vote (""raise your hand if you believe you can be anything you want"") and then, 20 mins later, remember roll. Theyll call another few names and then do the same thing, all the way til the end of class, never finishing the one task, always having it on the back burner though. 

If they simply only called the two or three names and then dropped roll entirely, that's fine I guess. But the hopping back and forth without ever finishing is maddening. 

Plus like, ok. In the two classes we have managed to get through two slides. One with a definition on it, and the other explaining that definition. That's it, as far as actual course material.

It's my minor, not my major, so I've never met the department head. I'm honestly so confused about how this person is teaching. I keep telling myself theres methodology here, because clearly they're academically successful and have some experience, but... where? How? They seem almost entirely incapable of even small classroom tasks, so far. It's kind of upsetting to see. 

The first day I thought they may just be flustered because they got the time wrong (that was their excuse, that they had not checked the time the class started and just assumed it was a half hour later than it was) and so things were disorganized cuz they were trying to rush. Going in and finding out this is just their M.O. was majorly disappointing. But maybe it's just first week jitters?

Arizona,"Eh, you're combining two types of smoke detectors into one description.

Ionization alarms actually work by using Americium 241 to charge air particles and create a current between two plates. Smoke enters the chamber and disrupts the current which triggers the alert and a response at the FACP/U. These detect larger particles in the air as well and are more prone to False alarms.  

Photoelectric alarms use a light source and a detector. Once the light is disrupted by even small particles in the air (commonly by dust in AZ, or potentially steam) then an alert is triggered. 

Dual sensor alarms use both of these, and the ones at ASU require both mechanisms to trip before an alert is triggered.",0.0896,0.6066,0.3038

242/241 are Managerial accounting focused. ACC 340 is purely Financial Accounting. The only topic that is managerial related in ACC 340 is inventory.

Other than that, your best bet is to review material that is similar to financial accounting (or ACC 231/232/261 related).

Furthermore, ACC 340 is heavily Financial Accounting. No mousy journal entries. No more asking “what do you debit” and what not. You will basically cover so much, that ACC 440 (Part 2 of ACC 340) only deals with investments, pensions, and a small number of other topics.

It also has a way to say what time the assignment is due, or I can just leave that blank, and I can request reminders - or not - if I so choose.

I was also able to put in my schedule of classes and it reminds me when my classes are, which is nice because I sometimes get the beginning/ending times confused. If I go to the calendar part of the app, it shows me what assignments are due on the day and what classes I have.

Arizona,"Alcohols elimination and metabolism is a tricky thing. It's first order verse zero order kinetics and our body doesn't process it as quick as other things. 

So like, you could take six shots and feel FINE, keep drinking and feel fine, and then an hour later die from alcohol poisoning. 

Also to mention, certain populations have unique body compensations that affect those pharmacokinetics. Body mass, fat content, presence (native Americans have a ton) or absence (Asians have minimal) of alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes, etc. also if you're on medications that also require liver elimination, those drugs/pro drugs in your body can ""compete"" with the booze and cause it to metabolize and eliminate slower or faster. So like let's say you're on a statin for family history of high cholesterol, and you're body is used to it and chooses to metabolize it first through the CYP enzyme pathway, you keep drinking cause you feel fine but an hour later when your body decides to pay attention to the alcohol, you're screwed. 

Then let's take other things into consideration that affects those natural body reflexes. Is the person on a benzo for anxiety? Muscle relaxant? Maybe they have asthma or COPD that already affects natural reflexes. Add copious amounts of booze to that and bam, your body's confused and you die from respiratory failure. 

And the foaming of the mouth is rare but usually an indication of serious alcohol poisoning. The body is trying to vomit but doesn't have the muscle capability to cause the stomach to cramp and push the vomit all the way up the esophagus. Or the person is so passed out they're laying in a way against gravity. Therefore the acid sits in their lower esophaguses or upper GI, acid bubbles come up, cause esophageal irritation and the ""foaming of the mouth"". One pathway it happens. 

And you've got a strong stomach and liver, kudos to your genetics and such. But everyone's body is different. And yours could change too, so be cautious. Especially if you start taking any new meds as you age. 

And i ranted and went on a tangent of horribly written science lessons again, sorry, but I do agree with your final thoughts of PACE YOURSELF. And if you're near a line, stay on the safer side. 😅",0.0499,0.3607,0.5894

I drank almost a whole bottle of Canadian Royal on an empty stomach and felt like complete ass the next morning but was still fine. I never came close to blacking out, and I was puking or feeling totally sick by the end of the night which always made me stop drinking. I honestly don't understand how this is possible given all the reflexes our bodies have to make it not possible.

Not hating on this girl but I just feel like this is completely avoidable 100% of the time. I think the moral of the story is if you feel sick or puke maybe it's time for you to throw in the towel for the night. And if you're smart... pace yourself next time",0.0179,0.1259,0.8562

I don’t understand but I don’t mind",0.1368,0.467,0.3962
Arizona,"Of course! In exchange, please, do share your take on those items below. Would love to hear your thoughts.

Just a quick background as it does certainly determine one’s perception of various things. I was born and raised in a country where the socialism took the most ugliest form of all. This probably has left a few scars in my mind regarding anything socialism related. I admit however that this over-skepticism does not really help me to get a real clear picture of socialist ideas. Another important thing that in part defines my political views is the fact that I came to the US absolutely legally, maintained my immigration status for 15 years, paid all the dues/fees/etc and became a citizen. It wasn’t the most easiest journeys though.

So here are two items where my take is not perfectly in line with the official Republican/right-wing philosophy.

**Immigration**. Being here legally does NOT make me hate illegal immigrants at all. I have met a lot of very good decent people who ended up here because of various circumstances and either lost their legal immigration status or were brought here by their parents. On the other hand, keeping our southern border next to non-existent is not a good idea because with many good people there come some very bad people as well. Bottom line: we need an immigration reform where both sides of the political spectrum should converge on. The sooner they accomplish this the better for all of us. The details of this reform is yet to be discussed.

**Climate change**: it is freaking here whether anyone believes it or not. Science doesn’t give a shit about your/mine beliefs. Period. What should we do about it? Well, something must be done for sure. If we do anything by ourselves but China, Russia, India keep polluting at the same rates, our efforts will lead to nothing. We thus need a president that can make every country step forward. It is going to be painful.

As a scientist I am used to change my mind if facts demand that. Politically my pathway started all the way on the left, moved to the very right, and brought me close the middle. Just as an FYI: I regret that I did not vote for Kyrsten Sinema. Her views and especially her votes when she got elected overlap closely with what I believe in.",0.088,0.3634,0.5486

I'm not trying to be taken seriously by numbnuts like you, you're hopeless. Calling a critique of Capitalism ""irrelevant"" just shows how insulated or stupid you are. I sincerely hope your daddy doesn't get laid off or something where you have to learn shit the hard way.

Edit: further, I am an ASU student and was initially talking about the OP's subject, both reasons I should be welcome in this forum (according to liberal ""free speech""), it was Billy Rationalizer who came in and started shit, but I don't see you criticizing him or telling him to go elsewhere.",0.0265,0.1541,0.8193

Just because westerners call them ""camps"" doesn't mean they are like what's going on down on our border or in Nazi Germany. The ""camps"" feed, clothe, and give vocational training, often to just petty criminals but particularly to people who have been radicalized- these radicals [have ties to western NGOs who literally fund Al Qaeda groups](https://www.counterpunch.org/2015/07/28/chinas-ngo-law-countering-western-soft-power-and-subversion/) to sew turmoil in the region and try to make China act belligerent toward these people. Unlike the west, though, instead of waterboarding people abroad, and making a big stink about muslims all being terrorists at home, they arrest these people and give them an alternate choice.

They don't say ""You can't be Muslim,"" they say ""you can't blow up shit around here, and here's some education and job programs"". They feed them, they treat them with respect, and recidivism is generally low. It is a solution to a crisis of poor infrastructure and poor education in a place in the far west that the Chinese just haven't had the material to build up (China is not like the US, the west has traditionally been super poor and lacking in human comforts; a great place to sew turmoil. Blaming this on Beijing is ignoring many years of western meddling and expropriation resulting in slow but steady gains in infrastructure and upward mobility which is now coming to a point that the government can finally pull everyone from poverty), but they are working on it.

No one is putting people in ""camps"" just based on their race or anything like that. They're called ""prisons"" over here, but at least the prisons over there don't force literal slave labor, making millions for private prison companies to keep 'em full; they serve the real function of rehabilitation. You can believe all anecdotes of people who say this, that, or the other thing about the abuses, but ignoring the fact that many of these people are paid by western entities the [same way North Koreans are](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/13/why-do-north-korean-defector-testimonies-so-often-fall-apart), the material facts just don't stand up to their version of the story and it's absolutely ludicrous that Americans have anything to say about human rights abuses of Muslims when both liberals (Libya, Syria, Yemen) and conservatives (Iraq, Afghanistan) have done actual wanton murder of these populations.

Arizona,"Part 2:

&gt; Immigration. Being here legally does NOT make me hate illegal immigrants at all. I have met a lot of very good decent people who ended up here because of various circumstances and either lost their legal immigration status or were brought here by their parents. On the other hand, keeping our southern border next to non-existent is not a good idea because with many good people there come some very bad people as well. Bottom line: we need an immigration reform where both sides of the political spectrum should converge on. The sooner they accomplish this the better for all of us. The details of this reform is yet to be discussed.

While I wrote about the anecdotal stories of my own experience above, I am a realist in the sense that I am totally aware that in terms of the people, with the good comes the bad.  One of the political buzzwords flying around out there is that Democrats are for open borders.  Metaphorically, that reminded me of that old Chris Rock movie Head of State where as he’s running for president, his opponent releases an attack ad saying, “Mays Gillum (Rock’s character) didn’t attend the latest anti-cancer rally… is he for cancer?”  That’s how I feel when I encounter advocates for the wall and their logical conclusion when they encounter those against the wall.

While I oppose the Trump border wall for many different reasons, because you mentioned yourself as a scientist, I want to share why I think it just won’t work: 
1) Building a wall in the manner that Trump seeks is not feasible.  The amount of money it would take just to create the road infrastructure to move the construction equipment on sight would be enormous. 
2) The courts would be tied up for years with the amount of imminent domain lawsuits filed by people unwilling to give their land away to the government. 
3) People good and bad cross the border for economic reasons...  some legit, some not so legit.  The cross because there is an economic demand in the US for something they have… again some legit and some not so legit.  The only thing that can stop these crossings is for there to be no economic demand here for what they are offering.  In this sense, think of the border wall as a middle man on an economic chain.  For better or for worse, the existence of a middle man will only serve to make the final product more expensive… hence violence, illegal drugs, and illegal immigration will increase, become more expensive, and more dangerous.
4) Not to be forgotten, Mexico has ladders and shovels.

I honestly don’t think there will ever be a conclusive solution to the southern border issue because it’s not in the interest of either political party to really fix it in a meaningful way.  While I know there are some Liberals and or Democrats that oppose the wall on a philosophical basis, I understand that there are others who see the influx of immigrants as a source of increasing political power.  On the other hand, there are many Conservatives and/or Republicans who see this as a security issue.  However, there are also many Conservatives and/or Republicans that again see an influx of immigration as a source of future political power.  For example: many people don’t realize that at our border crossings, only 1 out of like 6 (and I think that’s being generous) big rig trucks are inspected at all.  It’s because taking the time to inspect every single truck entering the US would create a back-up disaster that would throw a kink into and delay corporate supply chains causing loss of revenue, loss of shareholder value, etc. Another example is cheap labor.  Since corporations have a legal fiduciary duty to increase shareholder profit above all other consideration, lowering labor costs would provide an edge in cost cutting and profit increases.  I mean look at that story from the other week where ICE raided a chicken processing facility and arrested everyone “breaking the law” who wasn’t management.  Capitalism is about making and increasing profit, breaking the law by hiring undocumented workers is just the cost of doing business.  More profits mean more investment in political campaign contributions to candidates on the right.  Everyone at the top wins, so what is the incentive to change?  You can write all the laws you want, but there is no greater power out there that’s capable of enforcing them.
 


&gt; Climate change: it is freaking here whether anyone believes it or not. Science doesn’t give a shit about your/mine beliefs. Period. What should we do about it? Well, something must be done for sure. If we do anything by ourselves but China, Russia, India keep polluting at the same rates, our efforts will lead to nothing. We thus need a president that can make every country step forward. It is going to be painful.

I agree 100% with you there… Science doesn’t care about your beliefs and/or feelings.  I don’t think I will ever forget James Inhofe’s quote where he said he believed in climate change until he found out what it would cost to reverse it lol.  All I can say is way to go Oklahoma for putting that moron in government to represent you.

You’re point about China, Russia, and India increasing their pollution outputs is something I do not dispute at all.  I also agree that stopping unilaterally would put the US at an economic disadvantage.  I hope that it would be possible for a president to figure out a way to get each county to lower their emissions in a way that would also satisfy their national interests, but I don’t think Trump is even in that realm of cognitive diplomacy.  I honestly feel and in some sense fear that the only way to achieve that goal is a one-world government.

&gt; As a scientist I am used to change my mind if facts demand that. Politically my pathway started all the way on the left, moved to the very right, and brought me close the middle. Just as an FYI: I regret that I did not vote for Kyrsten Sinema. Her views and especially her votes when she got elected overlap closely with what I believe in.

Life is a journey my friend… I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone that got it all right the first time.  I know this was one long response and at some points probably went on a few tangents, but I look forward to your feedback and I hope this thread can show that civil discourse is possible.",0.0621,0.38,0.5579
Arizona,"&gt; Of course! In exchange, please, do share your take on those items below. Would love to hear your thoughts.

I really appreciate the discussion and I will format my response accordingly.

&gt; Just a quick background as it does certainly determine one’s perception of various things. I was born and raised in a country where the socialism took the most ugliest form of all. This probably has left a few scars in my mind regarding anything socialism related. I admit however that this over-skepticism does not really help me to get a real clear picture of socialist ideas. Another important thing that in part defines my political views is the fact that I came to the US absolutely legally, maintained my immigration status for 15 years, paid all the dues/fees/etc and became a citizen. It wasn’t the most easiest journeys though.

Yes, thank you for sharing this point of view.  It is one that I encounter frequently, and although there are those that will malign you for it, I do understand the reason for the view and the nuance of it as well.  People throw around political theories and buzzwords as if they all have one meaning (and by that.. it’s their definition only). If I grew up in a country where the power dynamic between the ruling class and working class was such that a brutal reality was brought forth through socialist ideas, I can imagine myself in your shoes.

The issue of immigration is one where I also understand both points of view.  I understand that it was not an easy process and you should feel proud that you accomplished it.  Without giving away too much information (since this is a public forum) my occupation deals with immigrants who some came to this country legally and some did not.  I have been working with this group of people for nearly a decade now and have grown close to many of the families.  As with such situations, they would open up to me and tell me how they ended up in the US and why they came.  The mother of the family had five boys and I met her and two of her oldest sons first.  They came from a gang infested central American country (I know that doesn’t narrow it down too much).  However, the reason she came here was to establish herself as very notorious gang killed her husband on their front porch for not joining them.  She is the hardest worker I know, and she has brought all her children to the US to join her and rebuild their lives.  None of them have legal status from what I understand.  I’ve heard variations of this story countless times from those I worked with, and the common theme is that it was leave their country or die.  They have to weapons to fight back against the cartels and gangs (and the corrupt police force for that matter).  This personal anecdote of mine (well aware it’s my unique experience) contributed to forming my view that yes the immigration system needs to be reformed.  Where I diverge with the right-wing (far right) and even with your views to an extent, is that people who came to the US the “right and legal” way know exactly what these undocumented people are trying to run from.  I feel that many who “did it the right way” look down on the undocumented with disdain as though they feel like they “cut the line” and “didn’t putting the same blood, sweat, and tears” they did.  My personal view is those individuals are absolutely right… the undocumented did cut in line and didn’t go through the same years long process of hardships that legal immigrants did.  However, on the other hand, my experience with the undocumented is that they just don’t have the time to attempt that same process.  Many people who want to come here the legal route that you did would likely die and their children would likely be conscripted into the gangs.  To sum up my point here, from my perspective (and let’s just for example say we are talking about legal and illegal immigrants from Honduras) on the issue is: Immigrants who went through the hard process of legally becoming a citizen appear to be against “illegal” immigration not so much because they “care about the ‘rule of law,’” but because they are pissed off that the illegal immigrant didn’t have to go through the hardships they went through to get the same thing: Living in the US.  This is the foundation of my view point.  Instead of immigrants helping their fellow man, because they know exactly why they are fleeing their home country, they are telling them to get in line and suffer like they did to do it legally.  It’s kind of embodies the “I got mine, fuck you” mentality I see on the right these days.  


&gt; So here are two items where my take is not perfectly in line with the official Republican/right-wing philosophy.

This might sound kind of crazy to the more left-leaning people reading this thread, but although I feel that the Republican Party is a dying entity and Donald Trump is the last hurrah so to say, I don’t want the Republican Party to collapse.  There has to be a balance or else you’ll find yourself with a far-far-far-left-winger that will take things and make it just as bad in a different context, but equally bad overall.  In my opinion, pure-right wing policies and pure left-wing policies, while they will take different paths, the will both lead to totalitarianism.  The only difference is which side is going to be the dictator.

Arizona,"My 2 cents is that all classes are created differently. CSE classes take *way* more time on average than poli sci classes. I don't want to argue about this, it's just how it is. A few quizzes and discussions with 1 or 2 essays and everything online is just not going to require the time commitment that CSE classes require. 

I've done 17/18/19 and 21 credit hours with this in mind.

Right now I'm in 19, but 6 credit hours of my classes are poli sci classes and A term (meaning they are condensed courses and ""require more time commitment""). Does it feel like a ""load"" of 25 hours? No. And I doubt it will. CSE courses are always more work nearer to the end of the course. Finishing these classes mid semester will then drop my effective ""load"" to 13 which I'm trying to add POS 401 to offset.

Overall, you know yourself. You have an idea of what your major is like. You should also know what kind of professor and have an idea of the class to judge whether you can do the load or not. Do you work outside of class? This can make all the difference.

Even if she is just new, surely the answer is to apologize for my struggles, thank me for bringing it to their attention, and then a class audit and a serious meeting about appearances and behaviors. 

The teacher clearly had been spoken to but only to the extent that she sort of explained the dogs briefly. She didn't allow for any questions and her explanation was simply ""they're alert dogs, they whine and yap to alert me of conditions"". She had, just the class period before, though, stated that one was untrained and the older dog was ""teaching them the ropes"". So, these dogs are not officially trained medical alert dogs at all. They're likely emotional alert dogs that let her know when she is stressed out or being manic. 

However, as students, her stress and manic behavior are already palpable. The dogs distractingly whining and yapping make it unbearably stressful and manic as an overall atmosphere.

I honestly feel like this is a Very different experience on who you get but I deal with anxiety and depression and I just wanted to function/ have the building blocks to exist and work happily. With extreme past trauma I think I was also considered a ""long term"" case but I had this lady who was really kind, understanding, and actually gave me sound advice/ safe place to talk abt these traumas/ask for help. Each session was an hour and I would say the worst part is probably the scheduling. I understand why they do it, but they ONLY call you, no email/ messages, and I usually have my phone on silent so I'd miss the call a lot but it became easier when we scheduled at the end of the session. I know my experience may not be the same but for $15 a session (sometimes free depending on your insurance) I got better help than when it was 500 a session from some uppity place. It may be imperfect, but it did get me away from being overwhelmed and start putting healthier coping mechanisms into my life.

Arizona,"Ok. So since you're pretty early in the game, hopefully this won't sound condescending.

The reason why it typically takes 4-5 years to graduate engineering isn't just due to the difficulty. It's because there very strict sequences of classes that build off each other. For example (from EE)

Calc1&gt;calc2&gt;calc3&gt;emag1&gt;pathways&gt;tech electives&gt;senior design1&gt;senior design 2. This stream alone is 8 semesters long. And there's other prereqs not shown, like needing physics2 for emag1.

Similarly there's (some number of calcs, unsure how many)&gt;physics1&gt;physics2&gt;circuits1&gt;circuits2&gt;circuits3&gt;tech electives&gt;senior design1&gt;senior design2. Note this stream is also about 4 years long, and that it's largely independent of the emag stream.

The point of me telling you all this, is that the total number of credits you transfer in is largely irrelevant. It's the length of the longest stream that defines your minimum time to graduation. So even if you somehow had all the way through the circuits stream, you would still need to finish all of the emag stream in order to graduate. Similar things apply to other engineering majors, but I am less knowledgeable about those.",0.092,0.5598,0.3482

Also I meant to say spring 2018 not 2017. I will do it in 3 years.

Arizona,"4+1 is the same thing as 3+1. The only difference is how long it takes you to get to your senior year undergraduate classes. Maybe they have certain maps but it's not like it's fundamentally different. I started CSE in Spring of 2018 and I'll graduate with my undergrad Dec 2020. I'm applying for the ""4+1"" to have my classes double count for the masters program. That's really all this program is. You take up to 9 (maybe 12) credits that ""senior"" year that double count towards a masters and then finish the masters in a year. (This might be slightly different from program to program.)

I started with 46 credits from purely AP tests. A lot of generals and a lot of classes that don't help me in regards to my CSE major. I can go into detail if you want me to, but overall definitely helped. 

But even just taking a high amount of credits and some summer classes, I think a 3+1 is obtainable for most people in most engineering majors if they want to sacrifice some of their social life, give up summers, or not have a job, and you know assuming they are not lazy and actually do work.

There’s not much to it. You memorize everything and then you apply it in little neat and contrived questions. What’s happening in this class is you’re getting ready to study bio for real next year, but first you gotta learn all the lingo. It’s a real shitty exercise in perseverance (and rote memorization)

Also, you don’t know how to study. If 20% of students are getting things right but you’re not that means the resources are there, but you’re not utilizing them. Don’t compare your performance to the classes’, btw, because high WFD (withdrawal/fail/D) rates are common in intro STEM lectures. It’s where the can-do’s get separated from the can’t-do’s and sometimes the stats for that can be scary.",0.0437,0.2455,0.7108

Best advice I can give you here is to treat school like a job. Schedule time you will study and do assignments, full stop. Weekends should be dedicated completely to homework and studying, if you have time to relax or do fun stuff that’s great — but finishing your assignments and studies has to come first. Even when you’re tired after work and school, come home and dedicate at least two hours to your studies. It sucks and it’s a lot of work, but it’s what you have to do if you want to pass.

With that, however, schedule breaks into your study time. If you want to be effective (and not go crazy), say for every hour of studying you get a 5-10 minute break. And when you’re on the study clock, throw your phone in the corner and close all tabs on your laptop except your assignments or study materials.

Tutoring was really helpful for me, as someone who is difficulty understanding the way math textbooks are written. Khan academy is also a wonderful option for having the concepts verbally explained to you with examples.

Arizona,"Lol. Not at 'you' but at the content of the comment, because I'm not new to this information, I feel like I'm in a loop. I don't just make posts on a whim or as a first step. Startup week is in March which was before I started working on this idea, I go to startup events, startup workshops and entrepreneur networking events which are great for meeting other founders and making actual business connections with other local/small startups because thats who is at the events, other entrepreneurs. Sure there are numerous other startups that want to use my platform (when the platform is finished that is) and work together, but I have yet to run into any developers looking to join a team. I'm not saying they don't exist and maybe I haven't been to the right one, but everyone there is selling their idea or making connections, and they tell me to look online or on campus. lol. 

That's the reason I posted here, when I ask the ones who have made it they tell me I need to put it out there find people, I can only talk to so many people in person, and yesterday was the umpteenth time I had someone tell me to just post. 
I chose the ASU subreddit because for one I attend the school, and two because I want to find those that are truly hungry (to do something) and local, but all I've found is people who are afraid, or those who are already working on something. Now I can see that from these responses, that these are not the people Im looking for. How can a simple 'just send me a message if you want to work on something' be interpreted as a scam? So do friends in engineering just work not on something to gain experience, if someone in your class leans over and says 'hey want to work on a project together?' do you just point your finger and yell 'scam'? Or do you ask about it before making judgement? (I know 'you' didn't say it, just in general)
--I'm simply asking if people want to not only work on something that is new, but have a chance to never worry about money again. Sure some may have too much going on and say no, but to say 'hey everyone he wants help and wants to help others but don't do it because it's a scam'- just seems so trashy. I thought better of fellow students. /rant

I just really wanted to not NEED an investor or outside money until a later stage, but I guess thats just me trying to scam some students into a better life. My mistake, I'll learn to be more selfish in the future.

Not that startups are 'uncommon', but what would you call something that less than 1% of people attempt?

It is in the cross-section of ecommerce and advertising. It is not a platform that needs to be creative in how it monetizes, it *IS* a monetization platform. It is something that industry is on the brink of implementing, it's only a matter of time before it's realized and I plan to get there first and with the right customer in mind. I've done the market research, the competitive landscaping, the consumer research, etc. and am ready to hit the ground running given the right team.

Ok so you have a bachelors and know how to program.. I get how it relates to the ability to build something, not so much in the realm of growing a company from the ground up without taking on debt (a key to following Aram's startup map).

1. I clarified on compensation and am not into advertising key details of my project on the internet at this point. I listed the tech I'm using, so if theres advice on what information others would like to know regarding what skillsets are required then I'm all ears. Do you mean what they would be doing with those technologies specifically?
2. I know that, and those who consider themselves 'professional' usually don't come cheap, and from experience (plus some ignorance) those who seem to 'glow' from recommendations and the like do not know more than the next, but know how to sell themselves or make others perceive that they know what they're doing. And there's another set of people who couldn't care less about public approval that can run circles around the former.
3. Ironic much? Coming from the one who used degrading profanity thrice unprovoked... ahh the internet. Not that you care but I'm a serial idk-ist... I seek out knowledge from every crevice I can, even to prove myself wrong. 

I signed off a student because I still attend classes but my focus is my future businesses.

Most projects I never published due to my high standards but ranging from 10-50k lines ranging from level creators on mac that published to my game on ios, to a modern automated version of 'limewire/napster' for jailbroken ios and many in between, and have moved to mobile web recently and got my AWS Developer certificate a few months ago. I came to ASU to meet people, sure I'm taking classes but more importantly I'm building a team of people with ambition and planting seeds for the future.

As for the compensation point, you are correct that I left out some critical information. I meant to include it at the bottom but rushed to post before I changed my mind.

As I have yet to secure funding due to me wanting to have an mvp or a more operational alpha than my current prototype before approaching investors, compensation would be in the form of equity (ownership), that would be decided by parties involved (members involved at the point in time). Shares would be released according to a vesting schedule that includes time and work accomplished.

I have spoken with a few potential investors who have given verbal confirmation of interest, which is all I've asked for (have never asked for money). Take that as you will.

And I’ll try to ignore you pulling the “kids wake up to work laborious jobs” because I know full well I’m privileged for getting the chance to go to college and sleep in dorms and shit.  And I’ll basically ignore you saying I don’t have a social life and must be slaving away at my studies instead of enjoying my time in college bc, well, I am doing those “fun things” you insinuated I wasn’t doing. Except go to the football games right now bc it’s too hot but cooler weather- yes. Oh-- and you just slyly including that SUCU stands for Stuck Up Cunt University because I am an idiot, duh. You must've felt so smart including that.

But the fact is I’ve asked these kids politely to be quiet before this whole event. I’ve been trying to be friends. And you know what? I heard them talking shit. Sure it might’ve been a one-off thing, I certainly poke fun at my friends about their funny texts, and I’ll definitely ask them again in the future, but they’ve made it obvious they’re not gonna take me seriously. The most I can do is hope they will be a little considerate. But I’m not an avid rule follower or a bitch for asking what can I do when kids are being loud at asscrack in the morning.  And yes, it was my mistake for asking why should I just try to ignore it when it’s not my fault they’re loud. 

This isn’t the first time these kids have been annoying and woken me up, so I will apologize for being what seems to be, a stuck up cunt. But you must’ve mistaken me saying they’re loud when it’s the middle of the day and I’m trying to study instead of trying to sleep as much as I can at 3 fucking AM. So sorry that you regret your college days as well.

Arizona,"Listen,

I was going to recommend that next semester you get enrolled at Stuck Up Cunt University...

But, I know that’s a rude thing to say, and really you’re just doing what you can to get a great education. You’re probably not a stick up cunt, so that’s really pretty piss-poor advice. 

However, the reality is that rules don’t mean shit unless they aren’t enforced. It’s a hard lesson to learn. You may be a stickler for rules, but the reality of life is that most people are not. They don’t give a shot about your need for peace and quiet because they have needs too. They have needs to socialize, and have fun. 

You can’t control people. The rules can’t control people. The people enforcing rules can’t control people. And you can’t control the people that are enforcing the rules.

You can only do what you can do. You control your *own* situations in life. Everyone else is right - You either suck it up, or leave. Put in ear plugs. They won’t drown out all of the noise, but they can drown out some of it. 

Need to study? You’re going to have to find someplace quiet. Try Hayden’s basement. Any library will have a quiet place to study. When things cool off, get outside. Set up a table somewhere on campus where there isn’t any traffic. Make your own quiet place - but keep in mind, few may respect the quiet place you set up.

If you want people in your dorm to be quiet, you’re going to have to take charge and lead the way. You’re going to either get one everybody’s good side and convince them quietness is the best way of life. Or, you’ll have to turn on the bitch deep down inside and get them to see that you’re a force that should be reckoned with. 

Maybe take a quiet approach. Sit in the hallway and meditate. Close your eyes, and just be - even with the chaos around you. Be calm, be still, be. Your fellow students will either make fun of you and mock you - or, you may strike a chord of curiosity in them, and they may sit beside you and also meditate, and they may see the power that calmness and quietness can bring. It doesn’t really matter what they do though- because their actions are out of your control. 

I get your pain... college can be a noisy place especially the first couple weeks of school. It’s fun, it’s exciting. Kids are away from home. They’re out of their parents reach. They’re free to do what they want for the first time in their lives. These years will be years that they will always remember. They are making new friendships that may possibly last the rest of their lives. When they are old and grey, they will look back on their first few months of college and reminisce. It’s an amazing time in one’s life. Not everyone has the opportunity. For every kid running around being noisy in the halls of Barrett, there are four kids your age that have gone to bed early because they have to get up in the morning to work on the construction crew fixing a portion of I-10 in the summer heat. They’re not out having fun - they’re out slaving away. They’ll never have the experience that a college dorm environment brings.

What I’m trying to say is this... get your education. But, don’t do it in lieu of all of the fun things you could be doing. Balance your opportunities while you have the chance. Four years from now, they won’t be there to enjoy.",0.0954,0.4096,0.495

The professors all seemed to really care about their subjects and were very engaging and knowledgeable. Special shoutout to Koster (SOS 320) and Bavousett (SOS 300) who I would highly recommend for a challenging course where you won't be wasting your tuition. If you are interested in the energy side of sustainability,  Kelman (SOS 314) was a challenging and good course, though I wasn't a huge fan of his lectures due to the way he talks - sometimes it was hard to follow him as he bounced between trains of thought and used a lot of filler words like 'um'.

They're kind of a waste of time sometimes, too. Every recruiter you talk to, especially from big companies, has virtually zero decision-making power in the hiring process and they're often not even engineers or scientists so they can't even assess your fitness for the company. What is True is that career fairs do help connect students with companies, but only because it makes students aware of said companies. They benefit employers because it drives competition and application count for their positions which allows them to be choosier when selecting new hires

Photos of my only child that don't have duplicates

My drivers license

My lucky dollars with multiple same numbers - picture liars' poker.

So I've been doing some researching and it is still possible to meet the 150 credit hour requirement without doing a Masters. I've heard that Louisiana State University (LSU) has some online upper division accounting classes that you can enroll in and that this is the route some people take without doing a Masters. I think the tuition for each 3 credit upper division class is around ~$750, so way cheaper than doing a Masters. So for 3 classes, its around ~$2500 total give or take. 

I'm planning on enrolling soon after I do some additional research, but based on what I've seen the AZ state board of accountancy does recognize credits from LSU.

Arizona,"1.a. I think you should still go. There is a lot to gain and nothing to lose even if you show up late.

1.b. Apply to ones that really interest you ahead of time. From my personal experience, companies  may find time for you after hearing this. To many companies you are not an actual candidate until you are in their system. Practice an intro - even if you dont use it, itll keep bullet points fresh in your mind. If you do not know about a company, research them while in line. Listen to what the person in front of you is being asked and prepare answers to those questions.

2. Sure. It costs the company money to have a booth at a career fair. Some companies will only attend one even if they have some positions better suited for the other.

3. If they are related and you can explain how being in them has made you a good fit, then yes. Since you haven't been in the clubs long they probably don't fit the bill. Projects are more your call. There are projects that take a day that they might be interested in, while a project that is only at the idea stage might not give you much to talk about.

Bonus: a lot of companies (especially big ones, with long lines) have no intention of interviewing you yet. They are just there to tell you about the company.

You can try to appeal to ASU housing about the service animal since your friend's situation seems severe. 

And something maybe while you look, you can make a gofundme? I know they take some portion of the money raised, but even if someone donates while you look, that still helps. Take it to social media so that more people can see it, and maybe ASU will be more pressured to accommodate or help.

You don't need any resources outside of maybe talking with him, you took 240 and 310 so you already learned everything that the projects require. 340 is just a test to see if you understood what you learned and if you can start a project early.

There is also a 20% drop rate or something like that. With that said, project 1 is still overwhelming even for the people who got it/did well (ime). Starting early is definitely necessary, but I don't know when your due date is.

One option I would recommend for getting help are going to office hours and TA office hours. Bazzi is very helpful and a nice man. Secondly, get help from classmates who know how to do it, they exist. Don't get the answer or copy code, but get someone to explain it to you. Students who have already taken the class are helpful too. 340 is a good opportunity to make some friends in CS and find people to work with, so don't be shy. Definitely ask around.

I don't really want to explain the project over text and on Reddit, but the #1 thing I saw people doing incorrectly for the first project was parsing. Please please read the document carefully and pay attention in lectures. Completing the parsing section is easy if you realize that you just need to write recursive functions that match his specifications. Do not try to manually parse characters with while loops or something. You should only ever need to use expect(), peek() and recursive calls/calls to other functions.",0.4307,0.4181,0.1512

Little investigation into this:

 I asked what is this charge ""Bkstr Publisher Negotiate Rate"" ?

She:  ""This is a charge that was placed on your account because you did not choose to opt out of the program. You received an email notifying you that your professor negotiated a special rate for required course materials. The cost of the program was emailed and students were given the option to opt out. The students that chose to remain in the program were charge for the materials that were provided electronically. ""

Me: ""What Email, only thing I heard about books from a professor is \*insert text from Background Portion""

But engineering majors have classes that can't even fit in any of the Brickyard rooms so whenever they do have a class in Brickyard, they end up having to walk from one of the left over rooms (usually COOR, Life Sciences A, or BAC) with a time-slot available all the way to BYE and it seems far from campus.

The reason why I think this is because you never see art/music/other majors have classes in BYE even though some of the rooms could definitely fit some of their classes. They only put us in that tiny faraway building when there's room for a class.

IMO the school just needs a decent sized building for engineering majors but that's probably at least a decade from now.",0.0657,0.4369,0.4974

With the whole application process, you'll need a proposal+few different documents. It's not hard to get into the FURI program, however, it'll require some communication with your professor. The only way for a FURI application to not be accepted is if it's apparent that the student didn't clearly communicate with the faculty mentor. For the pay, as long as you do everything that the FURI program wants you to do (mid/semester summary, FURI presentation, etc), they will pay you. Some of them require the mentor's approval in some way, so you can't just BS anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

FURI is a good way to gain some research experience, however, some parts of it can be applied to industry.

False.

From the article:

He was coming to campus either way. ASU's MSA accepted the invitation because they knew if they didn't, there wouldn't be anyone to provide counterbalance to his argument.

Arizona,"1. Did you read my first comment? It’s obviously a horrible crime and people should be aware of these scenarios and report to the police if they know anything about these incidents. This is all shit we had to go through and learn about when we first entered through college. So I’m not trying to be disrespectful and no my shock value on a crime like this isn’t lowered just because I receive a bunch of email alerts and my condolences go out to the victim.

2. When I first responded I assumed OP was a freshman who posted this because this is the first alert we’ve gotten this year and he/she was just putting it out there and was unaware of how often these reports are sent out to our emails/texts.

3. The reason I mentioned crimes not being reported often on here is because this sub doesn’t generally Have posts on something that people are already aware of or already happens a lot . We Already get emails about them through our student emails. I had a video taken down not even a week ago about a social experiment that occurred on campus and actually brought in as you say “positive growth” toward our students and help send a positive message to stand up to bullying, similar to the message in this thread that we should stand against those who commit sexual assault and be on the look out. But because I wasn’t aware of who these youtubers were and that they’ve already done similar experiments on campus before, I got put on blast and got my shit taken down. But this isn’t about me, I’m was actually helping OP by not hearing the same thing if he/she keeps posting every time we receive a crime.

So I’m not “bothered” by this post, I’m just shedding light on the fact that there’s a reason we don’t see these kinds of general posts all the time unless someone is associated with the victim and is seeking advice, and/or has a clear description on who the assaulter is, not just what’s given off on an email alert.",0.0315,0.3074,0.6611

The most important advice I can give is to talk with your communication profs specifically. They have the job you want, and they can give you the best advice on how to get there. Ask them about their path, and compare that path to the program you want to enter. There will be differences (different job market, your personal needs, etc.), but start by networking with people who already have the job you want.

If you are thinking about a university job, you will need a PhD. The 4+1 would not get in the way of that, but you will be a much stronger candidate with the thesis option rather than the project option. PhD programs look for people who can complete research projects, and completing a thesis demonstrates you are likely to complete a dissertation. You can still get into a PhD program with the project option, but there are few programs that prefer a project over a thesis.",0.3805,0.5542,0.0653

Arizona,"Well I first want to say I can only speak from my experience, so please don’t take anything to much to heart or do and I hope it helps. I am majoring in speech/hearing science and English linguistics. And from every course I’ve ever taken that has a writing component in it it’s really up to the professor.  From your communications class your writing may have been done well but your professor or ta’s (whoever graded the papers)  may have not agreed with what you said or  something and that’s why they bitches about it. There are a lot of reasons why they could’ve bitched about your writing, but also for a 100 level course a professor shouldn’t expect a student to be writing at a 200+ or  300+ level.  For the rock history class I can’t say I’ve never taken a music  course. But you did fail the class so  you should look at it from the perspective did you fail it because you didn’t try? Or because you didn’t enjoy the class so you didn’t put effort.  I have taken courses where I just couldn’t give a fuck about them and come pretty close to failing because i just don’t care. So personally for me if the rock history class is not going to affect your gpa then I probably wouldn’t retake. Nevertheless if you are transferring grades from a university/community college that isn’t asu your prior courses will not affect your gpa. For the English course because you received a letter grade of C if you choose to retake it and if you get a better grade ASU will not honor that grade because it is not a D/E.  With that being said English 101/102 can not be retaken for credits either. If you do decide to go into business you will have to take I believe English 301 or 302 which is business writing. It covers topics like professional proposals, emails and so forth. 

So basically it comes down to you can audit the course meaning you can sit in and join the class with out getting the credits if you really wanted too.  Or if you really wanted too you can try to talk to your advisor and see if there is a way to see if you could have a grade change and be able to take English 102 again.",0.0664,0.4516,0.482

I also got a C in English 102, so my friend suggested retaking it.  but i feel like 3 credits is 3 credits so it won't matter, right? I also am debating Associated in business special requirements and associates in applies science in to either Software Engineering, Engineering or IT or something else that catches my eye.

Arizona,"Of course. A few tips specifically for CSE (as opposed to CS):

1. Pay attention and make an effort to understand every math class you take, especially calculus and diff eq. Not only will this make your life easier (obviously) but for the CSE degree in particular a lot of hardware focused career paths are going to require a solid foundation in mathematics.
2. Pay very close attention in CSE 120 and CSE 230. You will be miserable come junior year of the major map if you slid through these classes.
3. IMO, circuits 1 should be taken at the same time as diff eq if possible. EEE 202 and MAT 275. They have a lot of overlapping content and it will be easier to study that way.
4. If you think physics is hard, don't let that deter you from the major. Anybody is capable of pulling through physics with at least a C and if you hate it/suck at it/its not for you, you never have to think about it again after Physics II if you don't want to. Circuits on the other hand, learn that. Embedded systems engineers (possible career path) and other hardware engineers have to understand the differences between AC and DC and how the hardware they build/code is going to handle that. They also have to understand principle circuit elements such as resistors, capacitors, buffers, etc...

The most important foundation classes in the major for success later on:

CSE 110 (where you'll learn how to make your first programs in java, which will give you skills to translate to any language you want to learn, be it imperative or object oriented)

CSE 205 (where you'll learn moderately in depth about object orientation, again with java)

CSE 220 (where you'll learn about c/c++, bash, and probably end up teaching them to yourself because Chen sucks)

CSE 120 (primitive digital logic design)

CSE 230 (more advanced digital logic design and computer architecture, exposure to data sheets, also you'll learn some assembly language you have a good chance of never using again)

MAT 243 (where you'll learn basics of algorithm function and growth. this one is deceptively easy, but if you slide by you're going to eat dirt in CSE 310. Certain topics in this class like proofs are useless and you will probably be able to discern which topics are worth remembering and which ones will be obliterated from memory after the final.)

If you understand all those classes (in addition to your math classes), you're set. You're still in for a hell of a ride given that CSE is considered one of if not the hardest CIDSE majors but if you can get those classes you've got the basics.

Just in general tips for CIDSE degrees though, obviously don't work on individual programming projects with others because you will likely 100% get caught and you will only be hurting yourself because you won't learn the material.

Stack overflow and java/c/c++ reference manuals are your friend... if you don't how to do a specific thing and you have to code it, use these materials. Despite anything professors will tell you, in the real world professional programmers use stack overflow because in the real world we have the internet and sources and etc. Don't feel bad for using resources. HOWEVER, do not ask your own questions related to any project you have on stack overflow (or chegg) because there is a high probability you will get caught. But if some other dingus asked the question... well. The tutoring center is also a great resource for programming related questions on projects, use it.

If you have any other questions DM me/reply... neck deep in hw that's all I got atm. Sorry for wall of text.",0.2481,0.505,0.2469

Poorer demographics are more likely to do things that they do not want to do in order to make some money, hence ""preying on students"" (individuals who are known for debt, being poor, etc). 

Imagine if prostitution was legal, do you think the rich people from the 'burbs would be going out and selling their bodies? Probably not, because they lack the monetary incentive (or at least that incentive is severely reduced, you get the point) to do that. The poor person may not want to sell their body, but the monetary incentive outweighs their own desires, so they go and sell their bodies.

The tuition reduction reduces your tuition down to $25 for up to 9 credit hrs for the Fall and Spring terms and 6 credit hrs during the summer. You still have to pay a million fees but the net benefit ends up being like 85-90% off.

Just find humanities and these non major classes that are easy As based on Rate My Professor and word of mouth if possible.

I just looked at the withdrawal form and I saw it had this option:

&gt;C) I am already enrolled in session B for the current term and plan to attend it. Because my awarded aid at the beginning of the term included session B, I understand that I must complete my class(es) in session B or I may owe some of my federal financial aid back (see Withdrawing as a Financial Aid Recipient for more information on this policy).

That seems to be the one that you want and it may not hurt you to submit the form with that option. But I would still put it off until you can actually talk to someone if at all possible to make sure that it won't make things more complicated for you.",0.143,0.5919,0.2651

Arizona,"P.S. If it was me, I'd be worried about this all weekend, which is not fun when you can't do anything about it. So here's some things you can do in addition to what I mentioned above:

To give yourself a bit of protection, you could open a ticket on MyASU describing the situation (leave out anything personal and just talk about how you thought you could have 12 credit hours for B session and you're working on fixing this). This will give you a paper trail. Attach the email you received with its time stamp so that you have documented evidence that you didn't know about this in enough time to get it done. Attach your email to your advisor as well. They won't respond to this fast enough, but again this is about establishing a paper trail of your efforts in case you need it later.

You can also call them. FA has a 24 hour answering service. They will only be able to give you generic answers, but again, this is about establishing a paper trail. You want them to know that you are actively working on this and not ignoring it.

Read up on everything so you're knowledgeable about your options and requirements before you see people on Monday. There are a ton of links in that email. Explore them all. Take notes. Write down questions to ask.

Try not to let it ruin your weekend. Do what you can, then put it out of your mind. But be ready to hit the ground running on Monday morning.",0.1214,0.5046,0.3741
Arizona,"I know it's the weekend which makes these things difficult, but I would not sign that form until you get things sorted. Signing that form may give them a legal right to basically screw you over, and you don't want to just hand that to them.

Also keep in mind it's the weekend, so they're not going to do anything before Monday.

Talk to someone in FA asap Monday morning. Bring the form in hand or be prepared to submit it online if you have no other choice, but don't do it until you've got some answers.

And see if there's any way you can meet with your advisor sooner. Email them and the department email and emphasize the urgency of the situation. Again, you probably won't hear anything until Monday, but they may be able to squeeze you in later that day.",0.0345,0.359,0.6065
Arizona,"It’s the weekend sadly, and I can’t talk to my advisor especially with only about 2 days left to submit the form since they sent the email three days after I withdrew. I think I may do the form right away since it’s stated that I need to do it and especially if I’m going to take classes in the same term which hopefully I can get another 3 credit class. I still want to talk to my advisor and I’ll make a phone call later today but it won’t be until next week when we can see each other or maybe even more time and by that time the time frame of financial withdrawal report has passed. 

I’ve already reached out for help at the student counseling services and started therapy/counseling last week",0.0856,0.5328,0.3816
Arizona,"Talk to your advisor. The course overload form is different depending on what college you go to, and they may be able to make other recommendations as well. Idk but they may even be able to get you back into one of the classes you just dropped if you want, if you talk to them and get permission of the professor.

I know right now you're kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place with FA, and you probably need financially to finish the semester out. But as someone who's also struggled with depression, I'd strongly recommend against the ""it'll be better in the future"" mentality. *Not* to be pessimistic, because I definitely hope things will be better for you soon. But I say that because that's not exactly something you can control.

If you absolutely have to take the classes (and again, I totally understand if you do), it would be better to prepare yourself mentally for doing them and *not* being well at the same time. Come up with a plan, get support in place, and if needed talk to your professors so that you can succeed *in spite of* your struggles, and not just magically hoping they will go away.

Edit: Also talk to financial aid. Go to their physical office if you can, because talking on the phone may just give you generic answers and the ticket system will take too long. Ask for an extension on the signature thing while you get this sorted out.",0.1863,0.5173,0.2964

She spent 7 days driving and spent about  600$ on gas/food/places to sleep going one way which was about 2,500 miles.

I went with her, to go visit her family this summer and the round trip tickets (for a red-eye flight) was also about 600$ and then luggage was 60$.

Arizona,"You know those electric scooters that were all
over campus last year? Well ASU didn’t ban them because they were dangerous, they banned them because they had fulfilled their purpose. 

What purpose you might ask? Well they were harnessing power through their kinetic and potential energies. Every student rushing late from class on a Birds, every couple on dates cruising around Mill Ave, every single electric scooter was harnessing power. 

Now what is all this power being harnessed for you might ask? Well you’ve heard of the ASU underground tunnel system right? The catacombs beneath campus all converge at a single point under Hayden Library. All that construction being done at Hayden right now, you probably thought that was for the new library renovations, it’s actually just a diversion. They need to cover up the REAL operation going on underneath the ground. 

What operation is that you ask? Well, all that power that was generated from the electric scooters is being sent through the underground catacombs into a giant power plant beneath Hayden Library. The power plant is guarded 25/7 by an army of ASU’s finest Monster energy infused Kyle’s. They only let one person in. Michael Crow himself. 

What does Michael Crow do in the power plant powered by electric scooters underneath Hayden Library? Well it’s quite simple really, he converts it with his holy touch directly into Innovation. This process normally is rather loud, so the Hayden construction process was created to cover it up. But today... today President Crow decided to use slightly more than 10% of his True power, and those were the booms you heard. Innovation booms.",0.1093,0.6004,0.2903

Arizona,"My number one piece of advise that changed how I treated school is to use the resources available to you. ASU is a massive university and it’s very expensive to go here, but because of that there are hundreds a resources, counselors, tutors, etc available to you. Meet with your academic advisor or career advisor ASAP. What’s the harm in talking with an asu official who knows how the school works? None! So meet with them! They want to meet you, your counselors want to help you. 
Another major tip piggy backing off of that one is do your homework on campus. All of it or as much as you can everyday. Struggling with math? Get tutoring in Wexler!! They have it every weekday until 8pm. I do all of my homework sitting in math tutoring wether I need help with it or not. It’s a very good environment to be productive in and you’re surrounded by tutors who only want to help you. The hassyampa tutoring center is open till about 11pm as well and they can tutor you on any subject not just math. 
Once you realize everyone around you wants to see you succeed and they want to help you, take advantage of it! Get your moneys worth out of your tuition. Seriously go to tutoring, meet your advisors, go to your professors office hours they offer them for a reason, do your homework on campus. You’ll be amazed how productive you can be while on campus for a day.",0.7119,0.2593,0.0288

Arizona,"My advice comes from things I've had to learn by first-hand experience, often the hard way:

- Don't put things off just because they're due at a future date. Waiting until the last minute to study for a test or to complete an assignment will hurt you, every time. If it's a small assignment, get it done asap. If it's a big one, pace yourself by doing a little every day.

- Learn to prioritize, because there are literally only so many hours in a day. This applies to schoolwork vs non-schoolwork, but it also applies to all schoolwork itself. Sometimes you have to sacrifice an assignment that isn't worth a lot of points but would take a lot of time in order to make sure you get other things done.

- Learn to scan a text for important information quickly, and take notes that will help you remember it. It isn't always possible or necessary to read *every* chapter assigned.

- Don't be afraid to ask for help! Professors, TAs, and tutors are there to help you understand the information. When you have real life issues that prevent you from getting something done, often professors can give you extensions as well. But don't abuse their goodwill for frivolous things.

- Find the nooks-and-crannies time. There are a lot of short amounts of time throughout a person's day that get wasted because they aren't very long, but together they can amount to a whole lot. During your commute, can you read your textbook or listen to an audiobook that would help you in your subject? While making dinner, can you review vocabulary? Can you squeeze out a few math problems on the toilet while you're squeezing out other things? Think about times when you're not doing much and figure out how you could better utilize them.

- Most importantly, make your mental, physical, and emotional health *the most important thing* in your life. Do not let trivial things get in its way. This goes back to prioritizing: don't be tempted to stay up all night playing games when you know it'll throw you off for days. But it also means being kind to yourself. Don't obsess too much over a bad grade here and there. Learn from your mistakes, get help if you need it, and let yourself move on. And of course, ASU has professionals who can help you stay healthy.

Arizona,"so step 1 : use your phone calendar. Don't rely on paper, it's really hard to prioritize. If you put everything into a calendar or to-do app with dates listed, you can prioritize which assignments/studying you should focus on. It also allows you to only think about things once instead of constantly having to keep them in mind.

As far as what parts of the class to focus on, this is where in-class participation matters. You can always ask questions like, ""is this what it will look like on the exam?"" or something like that. Teachers will also sometimes mention the exam while they're teaching. Anytime a teacher mentions an exam while teaching, make a special note of what they said and whatever part of the curriculum they were working on, so you know what should be a priority. If you're struggling with something, ASK IN CLASS IMMEDIATELY. Don't just be shy and let the teacher move on. If something doesn't make sense, ask until it does or until it's been long enough that you feel like you'd benefit more from one-on-one time (which means going to office hours).

It is an upperclassmen (though during my freshman year it was underclassmen because Tooker was under construction) dorm, but is more closer to apartments.

Downsides are that it is one of the older buildings and there are few amenities. A pool, laundry rooms, and realllllllllyyyyyyy bad common rooms. Though there is an advantage in this because you have to leave the building to do things, you can't just stay in the complex forever. It is right at the base of A mountain which is good for hiking. It is also right next to mill ave, the Tempe bus hub, the football field, basketball court, and a panda express.  


It's an option many overlook for the newer dorms/apartments. If you do decide, and this is good advice if you want to live anywhere on campus, reserve your room the moment you have access.

Arizona,"I can only give you my (anecdotal) perspective so take it with a grain of salt.

The career fair isn’t the interview (though sometimes there are interviews at career fairs). IMO the point of the career fair is to get information and establish initial contact with an organization. To that end I really don’t think being unique matters that much. I mean you bring your resume, you try to bring knowledge of what you’re looking for, and you honestly can’t do much more than that. If what you want (a paid internship) and what they want (an intern with qualities x, y, and z) align, then you can talk more. At that point you can think more about good questions to ask and how to appear interesting and competent because you’ll presumably be participating in interviews. 

If you aren’t what they’re looking for or they aren’t what you’re looking for, none of that happens; and that’s determined pretty much exclusively by your resume, you knowing what you want, and your ability to communicate like a regular human being. Sure if you ask unique questions the recruiter might think, “hey, nice question!”, which will quickly be followed by an evaluation of your resume and now we’re back at the top of the flowchart.

This is a long-winded way of saying worry less about asking unique questions. Figure out what you want, show up, and ask for it.",0.2447,0.5819,0.1733

2. CIS is basically what you expect it to be: computer programming and business. It's ideal if you want to get into the role of managing programmers/their workflow instead of being a programmer. You still get programming exposure albeit not as much. This is mostly based on people I know from the CIS program and people who left CS to go into CIS.

A big part of Computer Science is theory, which will teach you a good deal of problem solving. I feel like missing out on that would be a bit detrimental to your growth as a programmer. I hated it a lot but I respected it more as I went on.

I struggled with Calculus myself (and I went the CSE 259 route), but found Linear Algebra/Discrete Math way, way easier. Khan academy will save you though.

Arizona,"I am in my final class for MA in Global Security through ASU Online. This one will be long, but it's a list of negatives and positives I've found about online college.


I will start with the difficulties first:

The online structure of this program relies heavily on your ability to self regulate. If you are the type of person who can't make time for to study, write, and take tests then it will be tough.

Many struggles during standard college are also present online. Distractions from personal life, social media, and social life are still there.

For me, the lack of face to face interaction is difficult when I'm trying to request changes or corrections. I tend to come off VERY blunt and formal in emails which can be offputting or sound demanding. I actually have my wife read over any emails like that to soften the tone.

If you constantly need reassurance and extra guidance, it can be done but it is more difficult to obtain.


Now to the positive side:

If you feel sick or had a horrible day, then you don't have to worry about missing class and losing participation points. You wont miss vital information from a lecture. Just watch the lecture the next day.

I was able to work my full time (more than full time) job while taking classes because I didnt have to worry about leaving work to go sit in a classroom for an hour.

If you are an introvert, you can take the classes without being surrounded by people. Or if you are just feeling lazy you can study in your PJ's and hair a mess.

If you can self guide, then you will likely excel in the classes. Some people set aside a time every day to work on it, others like me will work little bits at a time through the day.

There is no need to relocate to take classes. You could go live in the country or the big city and not worry about not being able to take a class. This also means you dont have to pay outrageous rent prices around college campuses.


I'm sure I could continue with both sides but overall I find the online experience has more benefits for me professionally, while the standard college route had more social benefits.",0.3022,0.4733,0.2245

https://www.foxnews.com/science/plastic-pollution-oceans-2-5-trillion-impact

Also wikipedia could be bias towards whatever depending on the author who wrote the article. You can clearly see this when reading up on certain US presidents especially.

Also to be fair the US is up there in carbon emissions but you should only really be protesting it if you don't contribute to these carbon emissions at all. I mean like biking to school, carpooling anytime you go anywhere, not eating beef products and many other things which you can find in the article below. Essentially you should be consciously making an effort and leading by example to others if you want to spread your message. If you don't do these things you should just go to class and save yourself some grief later in life.

You can google more info on how to reduce your carbonfootprint if your really going to do something.

Because statistics and the scientific method works.

Masturbation works because it gives you the reward your brain is craving without any of the effort. After PMO, you don't have to do anything to feel accomplished. Yet, you have no serotonin you would receive from real sex. The anxiety is just YOU creeping up on yourself!  If you have 20 years into anxiety, you have nothing to lose.

Here is the study you’re looking for, and what all you pee brained nofappers mistake for evidence of sustained altered t levels.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/12659241/


It concluded that T levels in men were normal for a period of 5 days abstinence and then peaked at 145% baseline on the 7th day. No further fluctuation off base level was detected in the days following (I.e., it returned to the same reading that was measured on 0 days abstinence). There is no noticeable effect on long term levels. 


On masturbation, T serum levels are not altered by ejaculation and the frequency of ejaculation in men does  NOT alter t serum levels (I.e., your t serum levels remain constant no matter if you jerk off once or ten times a day. There are small fluctuations in T that occur during stimulation and orgasm but it is returned to baseline quickly after ejaculation.)",0.1779,0.6458,0.1763

""In fact, a study Trusted Source published in 2001 found that refraining from masturbation for three weeks may cause a mild increase in T levels. Another studyTrusted Source from 2003 found evidence that T levels may increase by nearly 150 percent seven days after you’ve stopped masturbating.

A 2007 study on rats found that frequent masturbation lowered androgen receptors in their brains. Androgen receptors help your body use testosterone. Another study on ratsTrusted Source showed that frequent masturbation increased estrogen receptors. These assist your body in using estrogen. Over time, frequent masturbation may affect the overall ability of your androgen receptors in utilizing testosterone.""

Arizona,"&gt;I don't know what stigma that is he's saying.

That stigma is very bi-modal.  Most PIs either like it, or hate it, there's not much middle ground in my experience.  Part of that probably stems from the fact that master's student are almost outright declaring they have no interest in Academia or ""story"" projects.  Anecdotally, I find the 4+1 students less invested in the results of their work and more interested in the volume and body of it.  They don't really care to get something meaningful, they just want to ""tick off the boxes"" so to speak for graduating.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I went to a lab that has a PI which already has two 4+1 students.

That's likely because it benefits the PIs, they don't have to pay tuition and stipends out of their own budgets for 4+1 or master's students.  Depending on the nature of the work that can really behoove the PI because master's students can be used to gather prelim data for a grant application then pass that work off easily to a PhD / post-doc if the work gets funded.  Mind if I ask what ""kind"" of lab it is you're in that has two 4+1s?  Wet bench biology?  Computational?  Physics?  etc etc.

Never called them a liar.  Does these things make it easier for baristas?  Yes of course.  Could Baristas make things easier for Baristas as well?  Yes, and that's the point.  You're getting paid to do this, we're paying your parent company to do it.  The onus should be on YOU to make YOUR OWN job easier.  Not pawning it off to the customer because you're lazy.

Never said that.  In fact, explicitly said you should deny customers that are trying to game the system.  Please read before you go off half cocked.

Arizona,Anddddddd it's a nothing burger.,0.0761,0.5131,0.4108
Arizona,"Hey there. As of this summer, I was admitted into the Computer Engineering (CSE) 4+1 program. To be admitted into the 4+1 program, you will need to apply the  after the last semester of what is considered your junior year. This is because they need to see how well you did in the 300 level courses that you take in your junior to make sure that you will be admitted into the masters program of your choice. I believe you are supposed to have at least a B or better in the courses you take your junior year. 

When it comes to how the 4+1 program actually works, once you are admitted you are essentially a graduate student in the last year of your bachelor's. There are 9 credit hours that can double count for both your bachelor's and master's programs. One of the main benefits to the 4+1 is that your undergraduate scholarships are eligible to be applied to the first year of your masters since you can double count these 9 credit hours. Another thing to note is that you are allowed 6 credit hours of 400 level courses that can apply toward your 4+1 master's degree. Another huge benefit to the 4+1 program is they waive having to take the GRE exam for students accepted. It's just one less thing you have to worry about when it comes to your graduate school. For Fulton, we also have a thesis and non-thesis options. I personally chose the non-thesis option which will require me to take a comprehensive exam based on two of my required courses and maybe one or two others I also take (I am not quite sure how this part works yet). They offer the comprehensive exams once a semester and it would have to be taken the last semester of your masters program. If you were to fail it, you would have to wait until the next semester to try again.

The application process (at least for Fulton) has changed a little in the last year or so and I can't be entirely sure my experience will be the same for you but I'll at least let you know how my application went. 
For at least the CEN and CS 4+1 programs, if you have a 3.5 or higher GPA you are not required to have letter of recommendations in your application. When I went to submit my application, I was told to just use three random email addresses for those since they use the same graduate application for normal grad school as well as the 4+1. I was also told to not apply until after I finished my second semester of junior year since they cannot review your application until grades for that second semester have been submitted. It was just a waiting game of whether I was accepted or not at that point. 

Note that all of what I said I learned being in Fulton but I am assuming most of these requirements, if not all, apply school-wide. Double check with a 4+1 advisor and on your school's website as well. I chose the 4+1 because I'm not only saving money but also finished my masters quicker than I would if I came back or started after I finished my bachelor's. I am already working in my industry since my internship this past summer kept me on part-time during the semester so I might even try to have them support paying the last year of my master's.

I notice that a lot of people seem to be low in confidence for speaking because they don't want to make mistakes or look stupid, but that's the whole process to learning. The more you speak with natives, are immersed in a foreign language (either via in person or through media), the more you would pick up how to process speech and make your own more quickly. Does your current class go over conversational speech or is it still formal? A lot of people in my Japanese class are caught up on small nuances that you'd only know if you just keep watching programs or talk to other people to a point where processing what is being said is second nature. I'm unfamiliar with ASU's Spanish program so I cannot speak for specifics, but there are a lot more people who speak Spanish and are willing to learn English, and help others with their own grammar and conversation. 


You mentioned that you don't have much time to dedicate for extra studying, but I'm not sure if much can improve unless you allot time to do so. Language learning is an ongoing process, and you get better with the more time you spend. One of my close friends is an international student from China. The reason why her English is so good is because she barely talks to other Chinese students here, and she just immersed herself in English. If showing up during a designated time is an issue, consider looking into finding TV shows you can watch on your own time and actively listen to conversation to grasp their meanings, and use apps like HelloTalk, which let's you converse and call with people for whom their targeted learning language is yours and yours is theirs. I used to use this a lot to understand nuances in words and speech when I first started learning. 



Other than that, the main takeaway is that you shouldn't feel discouraged from speaking just for the fear of being wrong or not understanding. You can always ask people to reiterate or say certain things differently so it's easier to grasp",0.4131,0.475,0.1119

&gt;Keep in mind there are occasional food/drink items they don’t get because they aren’t corporate.

People go to a franchised location and expect the services of that franchise.  If you're not providing a nationally advertised item.  You should make that clear AHEAD of time.  If someone sees a commercial in the area for an item at starbucks, it's perfectly reasonable to expect starbucks to stock it and ""it's not on the menu"" isn't an excuse because limited time / promotional items often aren't on menus.

Yeah and that's not our problem, it's yours.  If someone makes it through a line out the door without finding out your reader is down and nobody knows how to use a credit slide, then that's your screw up.  Post a sign and make an occasional announcement so people can prepare or leave.

&gt;Eco-friendly/Personal thought. If you come to Starbucks every day, or even multiple times a day, PLEASE CONSIDER getting a reusable cup/mug/thermos. PLUS we take off $0.10 when you bring your own cup anyway! (This also applies to refills).

The cup, lid, and sleeve probably cost close to $.50 combined; you have no control over that discount but still kind seems like a raw deal for a joint that charges 3$ for a cup of coffee.  Most smaller shops offer better deals on BYO.

If someone is willing to pay for your product and you can truthfully charge &amp; make it that way.  Just do it.  To even allude to it as ""stealing"" while your markup ranges into the 400% territory for anything with more than 2 shots is laughable.  You don't want people to finesse?  Charge fairly rather than adding an artificial premium because you know enough people will pay it.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Excuses like “I’ve ordered it before” is pretty rude since we always have trainees who don’t know those policies yet. 

Honey, you need to learn the difference between a rude excuse and a reasonable argument.  It's normal to expect the same service or product from the same location when you make the same order.  We may need to briefly explain it and that's ok, but to have menu policies change arbitrarily with your employee turnover is not ok.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Just order normal drinks, or go somewhere else.

There's that ""kindness"" at work.

A prospective juror may be excused if he/she:

* Has a physical or mental disability that would prevent him/her from serving. The prospective juror is required to provide a doctor's note explaining the disability. If the prospective juror does not have a doctor, a professional caregiver can provide a sworn statement explaining the disability instead.
* Provides a [Request for Medical Excuse from Jury Service](https://superiorcourt.maricopa.gov/media/1042/medical-excuse.pdf)
* Must provide actual and necessary care for another and alternate arrangements are not feasible.
* Will suffer an extreme financial burden if required to serve that would substantially prevent the prospective juror from paying his/her necessary daily living expenses.
* Is unable to read or understand the English language.
* Is at least 75 years of age and wishes to be excused from this summons, or this and all future summoning for jury service.
* Is an AZPOST certified active peace officer employed by the State of Arizona or a political subdivision.
* Is Active Duty Military stationed outside of Maricopa County.

Only the judge in the appropriate civil, criminal, probate division; the justice of the peace; along with the city magistrate can excuse you from jury duty in a particular hearing. You could be reassigned to another hearing immediately or in the future.

Being a busy student is not considered a valid excuse from jury duty.

&gt;Lol you're really worked up

I'm not, you're just a shitty person with shitty answers that would rather call someone asking for information ""ignorant"" than provide that information because you know you'll get fake internet points for it.  

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;You started off your first rebuttal to me by saying something that was wrong, and you're mad that I picked that apart.

You didn't ""pick it apart"" you didn't even answer the actual question regarding team ranks then linked to a wikipedia article on  tournament scoring that actually refutes you by saying, ""Almost no scoring systems use this"".  Or did you not read your own source?  If you want to speak in terms of absolutes then I guess, yes, somewhere in the history of golf there are scoring systems that count up for a tournament.  Nobody cares and it's irrelevant to the discussion of these rankings ACROSS events and because all these appear to be are ""coach points"".  

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;You didn't say you were an expert, but you did go with ""Maybe you've never played golf but..."" and said something was incorrect

Again because it is not apparent how the NCAA scores work when stroke play considers lower scores higher and these ranks literally have nothing to do with the scoring system you linked.  It's like you're trying to create a ""gotcha"" moment with semantics rather than answer the question.  The system you're alluding to isn't even used so yes, in a vacuum you are ""correct"" that there are scoring systems that count up.  Just not anywhere that it matters relative to NCAA D1 golf, grats on being the fastest kid at the special olympics.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Like you've still never actually defended why your original comment wasn't ignorant. 

Look you dense mother fucker, I admitted it was ignorant because I am ignorant of how you score the teams.  That is why I was asking.  It's apparent your grip on the definition of ""ignorant"" is tenuous at best but IGNORANT is not the same as DEROGATORY.  If you are upset that my comment was derogatory, that's another thing.  I don't need to ""defend"" my ignorance when the entire goal is to dispel that ignorance you pompous prick.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt; Before I even commented, you got butt hurt about getting downvoted, calling everyone doing so ""salty""

And if you want some details of how golf is actually competitive on a head to head level, honestly, the best thing I say is look into [The Tiger Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Superstar_Effect). It's the most all encompassing example, but there are a lot of subtle events throughout a golf tournament where players effect each other. One lately that has got a lot of media attention is the issue of slow play, where a slow paced player gets an advantage over a faster paced player, because they bring the round to their speed, and it can throw the faster player off their rhythm. You also get the disadvantage of hitting first in a group. If it's clear the first player to hit had their ball dramatically effected by wind, the next player(s) can make adjustments accordingly. And then there's just the mental adjustments based on your competitors. People play different if they know they are ahead or behind in a round.",0.0581,0.4025,0.5394

Whatever you say wanabe champ.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Well I do play golf, and I can say you just proved your limited knowledge of the game. 

Well clearly, I admitted that in the first post.  Which is why I asked how it's scored.  YA GOT ME!  Heaven forbid I throw some stereotypes into a post asking, legitimately, how you rank teams.  Way to be ambassador of the game and break down that elitist stereotype.  Speaking of which, forgot to include that one.  I don't know why you're lording my ignorance over me when I never claimed to be an expert.  Most people's exposure comes from PGA tourneys.  Guess what...there's no teams at the PGA level so it's hard to draw that logic down to scoring an institution when every professional event is individually scored.

&amp;nbsp;

The question was, ""How is a team ranked?""  And your useless as a bishop's balls answer was...

&gt;College golf is played in tournaments where individual players and the teams are scored.

Oh ok.  So there's scoring involved.  MYSTERY SOLVED, PACK IT UP FOLKS.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;So your credibility in golf knowledge is gone.

Fucking a, I'm literally asking information and you FINALLY get around the providing some of it.  Thanks?  I guess?  Could have just said that in the first post instead of calling me ignorant and fellating your own putter.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The reason I'm calling your post out for being ignorant is because you just threw out colloquial stereotypes about the game by bringing up scrambles, drinking, and mini golf.

No shit sherlock.  It's rhetoric, sorry I didn't put a /s in there so your fragile ego didn't get bruised.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;At the elite level, it's ""you vs the field"", which isn't too far off from how you rate track and swimming as races.

Bullshit.  In swimming there's tactics involved around drafting your opponents wake before making a passing move.  Last I checked, in golf you don't strategically follow behind someone's caddy from hole to hole.  ""You vs the field""; tell me how in any meaningful way, an opponent's play directly impacts your own, OH-GOLF-GURU-ON-HIGH.  And don't feed me some shit about his ball marker on a putting green being a strategic obstacle.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; these guys aren't struggling to keep the ball in play like you.

You wound me, sir.  But you still haven't gotten around to explaining how the teams are ranked beyond ""coaches poll"" so for all your blustering, you're just as ""ignorant"" as I am.


&amp;nbsp;

Even in the article you linked there's this gem...

&gt;Very few professional tournaments have used a Stableford scoring system.

I understand how an individual tournament is scored, doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out.

&gt;Maybe you've never played golf but NOTHING in golf is scored in points with a higher number being better.


Well I do play golf, and I can say you just proved your limited knowledge of the game. We can start with [Stableford](https://www.bunkered.co.uk/golf-news/stableford-the-golf-scoring-system-explained), an official game where scores by hole are awarded points, and the highest total of points scored wins, or [Match Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_play), where the score is counted by most holes won by a player in their match. Or look at the [FedEx Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx_Cup#Format) on the PGA Tour, where players accrue points over the season.


So your credibility in golf knowledge is gone.


The reason I'm calling your post out for being ignorant is because you just threw out colloquial stereotypes about the game by bringing up scrambles, drinking, and mini golf.

I get this a lot too when I go to visit an Asian country and people think I speak their native tongue lmao. It's disappointing to them when you reply in English that you don't understand.


 &gt;But for the most part, I would say it's much less of a fear of being wrong and more, *shit, I have no idea what the hell to say right now.* My buffering time for speaking is too long, I guess? But reading and writing is fine, just slower than English, ofc.


Do you naturally not have a response quickly in English? There are things I would want to say but don't know how to convey those words at times. I found that exposing myself to more phrases helps in the process of getting my ideas out, if I have any at all. If it's just a matter of not knowing what to say, I don't think it's an issue of language knowledge but more of what is appropriate to say. People tend to have a second personality too, when speaking a foreign language. I'm not sure if this applies to you in any manner but it's noticeable in others when you hear them speak English and how they conduct themselves in another language.  


&gt;Congratulations on almost finishing the Japanese minor. I took JPN 101 forever ago and I can't even read my old essays anymore, lol. Now that you're almost finished, how do you feel about the Japanese program at ASU? If there was more time in the day, I probably would have continued, but those 5-credit intro classes were a lot of work.

Thanks man. Yeah 5 credits really take a toll on how much time you have to commit, but once you enter the last 2 classes, they become 3 credit hrs. I decided to take this minor on later than I should have (bad mistake, should have taken it earlier and committed earlier for a more balanced course load), but it works out in the end since I have time to complete the minor before graduation. I think the main thing is that languages like Japanese and Chinese are not very similar to English like Spanish, so they do require plenty of effort just to manage. Usefulness of the language also varies on career goals; if one never decides to work in Japan or at a Japan-located branch, the proficiency is useless. But Spanish speakers are everywhere in the US and it's a more realistic and applicable language. 

There are a lot of things the professor who wrote the curriculum could've changed (huge imbalance in writing/reading vs. conversation, where people in the last classes, 301/302, would either not know how to talk to natives who study abroad here, or are fluent because of their own interest prior to taking the class), as well as what words to study, but for the most part the course is alright at best. The problem is that the Japanese department of SILC is stubborn to get things resolved because they don't like hearing that what they created and are doing is not the best way, in regards to curriculum. 


For anyone actually considering taking an Asian language course, if you're serious about it and want some realistic career prospects, consider Chinese. Huge influx of people speaking Mandarin in all universities, huge exposure, and the Chinese job market is growing and targets English-Mandarin bilinguals with other expertise.",0.0781,0.3922,0.5297

Also the way with the lights, they are right down on us, any screen has a glare and a lot of times it covers the total amount we typed in and like I said if someone doesn’t check or assumed they typed it correctly, that’s how someone gets overcharged. And it slips through us because we have to click whatever card type you have (visa, discover etc) to close the sale and all it says when you press whichever one that the order has been paid in full amount. It doesn’t tell us how much the machine took out because they the register and the credit card reader aren’t exactly together to one another, the register is just there to close the sale and print a receipt while the credit card reader is there to collect the money. 

And since we do try to be fast, and someone doesn’t realize they made a mistake by putting the wrong total amount, they won’t check the receipt because it wastes time. Especially after they confirmed what you ordered with you because then all we see is just ether amount each items costs and the total. There is no notification or anything to indicate to us that what the total was and the amount paid is incorrect.

&amp;nbsp;

That some logical coherence doesn't exist in golf.  You don't pick individuals to compete that are strongest on each hole, you don't grab the guy with the monster drive to lead on a par 6 then choose your best chip shot to take it from the fairway over to the green.  It's entirely an individual player vs course kind of thing.   Also unlike gymnastics, you don't look at the sum of the scores and say well, ""Chad McLongdrive shot a total of 12 under but his teammates were all 15 over so he doesn't win shit"".  No, he still wins the tourney regardless of how his teammates scored.",0.1146,0.5632,0.3222

Means that places like UHouse don’t count, 922, Rise, and any of those shops that line Rural. 

That doesn’t cover the 38,000 of us that walk to our cars, board the light rail in the dark, or walk/ride to school from off campus locations. 

I guess my point is that I get pretty freaked out what the figures are actually like. One of my close friends was mugged when she was walking to her car on the Downtown campus. She was walking to the lot behind the YMCA, and because that lot isn’t “ASU soil” it went unreported.

Arizona,"It's a multi-level marketing ""company"".

Basically, if anyone tries to offer you a job and it involves-

* Paying to work, having to buy their products to sell
* Contact person avoids discussing the fine points of the business over any medium besides in-person
*  ""Conferences"" that the company hosts and you have to pay to attend
* Contact person wants to ""mentor"" you to help you be successful

These are all red flags of a MLM, or multi-level marketing scheme. They are not illegal, as pyramid schemes are, but they share many of same systems and ideas. 

MLMs work in two ways which are selling products and recruiting.

1. Selling products
 1. You have to purchase your own inventory of their products to sell
 2. Products are usually based around the company's theme, such as kitchen supplies, clothing, home services, and so on
 3. Very little money is made by selling products

2. Recruitment
 1. When an ""employee"" recruits somebody into the MLM, they get a cut of that person's sales.
 2. This ""relationship"" exists all the way down, so for example, if person A recruits B, B recruits C, and C recruits D, then A is making money off of their own sales, B's sales, C's sales, and D's sales. Whereas D is only making money on their own sales, which would be very little.
 3. This is where some people make a lot of money in MLMs.

These businesses are scummy and they are well aware, which is evident in their recruitment which heavily targets young people who are more likely to be ignorant of these practices. Income is heavily favored to recruitment versus selling products.

So I try to just keep going back to my headphones but she starts asking me questions about God...then I put it all together. I tried to nicely explain I wasn't religious.

There are plenty of parking areas, etc that are utilized by students that the larger student body should be aware a crime occurred in even if its not technically on campus.

I thought it was a friend of my neighbor’s(our apartments share a same front door but splits into different units once inside, he’s unit A and I’m B). It kept going on and I was annoyed this dude was knocking so loud at 2 in the morning, and I figured the guy in A must be doing something and I was about to knock on his door to let this guy in, but then he started tapping on my window. I was going to let it go on until he got tired and left. He wouldn’t and I finally had to raise my voice and told him to quit tapping my window and speak to the man next door if that’s who he was looking for. He replied my bad and wandered off and I didn’t hear anything since then.

But what got way too strange and coincidental is that I saw a story on reddit a week ago about someone who went to asu in 2006, and during that time there was a notorious serial killer known as the baseline killer, and in the story the woman explained how the killer actually showed up outside of her apartment and began tapping on her window as well late into the night and she managed to scare him off.

The shuttle is a pain when there is traffic.

And always ask the bus driver where they are going, I have seen the sign say different than the destination and people get on and ride the bus going the opposite way they thought they were going. 

Take some classes the other campuses just to do it.  You probably should just so you have the experience of taking a few classes at Tempe and a few downtown.  Also the food, you can go to lunch at so many different places it is nice.  I mean off campus.

Even if the professor sucks in teaching the class (90% of CS profs), they're still probably quite intelligent and can help more if they don't have to cater to the whole class.

You can pass by normal studying but if you want a good grade then be prepared. If I were to take it again I would read the lectures before hand and pay attention in her lectures. I say this because you can access the slides and it will make you not want to pay attention to the lectures as you can just review whenever, but often times you will find yourself unable to piece the mess of information together, which she does in the lecture.

Repeatedly ignoring the summons is contempt of court and a judge can issue a bench warrant / body attachment, this is a civil arrest warrant.   With that, a peace officer can arrest you and bring you to the court on a routine traffic stop or other interaction.  You will also be responsible for impound fees on your vehicle.

&gt;It is unlawful for a juror who is summoned and who fails to obtain a postponement or who is not excused from jury service to wilfully and without reasonable excuse fail to attend on the date scheduled for jury service.  If the person fails to respond to a second summons the court may issue a body attachment as for a direct contempt of the court.

It’s not on any single police department, rather on the school itself to report the crime as part of it’s a) annual report and b) it’s timely warning system. Sidewalks that are directly adjacent to ASU are included in this. What’s not included is traveling between CAVC to the Brickyard, or even between the brickyard and the Centerpoint building. Its bad on the downtown campus because you have people parking on the Filmore lot, walking to the McKinley lot, and those areas are not covered by the Cleary act. It paints an inaccurate portrait of the crime that happens to/around ASU students. 

I mean, I can Google that shit, ElBarto. Anyone can. That’s not the point I’ve tried to illustrate.

**Dropping a class-** This is done before the drop/add deadline, which is typically a week after classes start for session C. 

**Withdrawing from a class-** After the drop/add deadline, you can withdraw from a class. This will result in a W grade. For session C the deadline is November 6 and for session A the deadline was September 11. 

Both of these options are available through your MyASU homepage. Select the 'registration' button under your course list, pick the option you want, then follow the instructions. 

**Complete Session Withdrawal-** If you miss the deadline to withdraw from a single class, there is one remaining option. The complete session withdrawal allows you to withdrawal from all classes in the session. This is an all-or-nothing option. The deadline for this is the last day of the semester, not including finals.  For a complete session withdrawal you have to fill out a paper form and submit it to your home college.

It is work, not a place where life is easy or necessarily fun. You do your job, you get paid, and you go home.

The truth is that showing up to work is efficient enough and trying to run the place more efficiently is just not worth it for most entry level jobs. If they wanted to make the place more efficient they would replace you with a machine. A lot of ASU classes that discuss the workplace and work environments never recognize the base level jobs. Always places like Boeing or Honeywell where company culture is important as the workers are high level professionals who can't be replaced on a whim. At this level, you take what you get for the money, experience, and possible reference. Trust me, I work at a slightly above base job at campus and it is hardly perfect. Some times it is just quantity over quality.

For your fellow full timer, did you ever stop to think that there could be a reason why he is always late. Is it possible that management already knew about it and it was planned? Full time workers get more rights then us student part timers. It is their full time job after all. I'm sure the bookstore like virtually every other place has an issue with students that never show up or constantly shows up late. A good number of students take the work for granted, especially if it is their first job and they are ""destined for greater things."" Maybe the full timer was a bad employee, maybe not. NEVER assume without knowing their background.

Just because you were not super happy with your job doesn't inherently make it a bad place. Some jobs suck and there is no changing it. That is the reality of work. As a student, you do your time and get paid. You add that job to your resume. You hopefully get your manager to be a reference for you. And you use them to ascend to better jobs. Unless you have an easy in at a company, you will have to go though the slog like the rest of us.

The whole splitting up students based on major is flawed and hurts some students like me (I’m good at working with other engineers, but not living with them).

I would totally get a house if that’s possible. Just be sure to still join clubs and meet new people. I hate dorming. Roommate was randomly assigned and it’s been nothing but hell so far. I’ve started to consider transferring to my state school bc of it. Barrett is a little better from what I can tell, but you still can get unlucky.

And outside of dorm parties, pretty much only frats throw parties. It sucks because since the GLV they’re all off campus. When I go to my state school, I can walk into a frat party if I vaguely know someone inside. Here you have to figure out the address in advance.

Be effective with your time and know when to look for help. A big proponent of being damn close to graduation myself is the “I’ve only got ___ minutes to get this done” mindset. If you only set aside 1 hour to do an assignment or master a problem set, you will find a way to do it an 1 hour versus allowing yourself to space out the assignment.

You don’t get it do you? Life isn’t about being happy or comfortable. Life is about competing. It is about pushing yourself to your limits and trying your best. Anything else is mediocrity and I can’t stand it. I used to be nothing in this life— looked down upon by most. And now I have a foothold in my fitness, in my finances, and in my schooling. If you grew up being bullied, and having to staple the soles of your shoes back on because you couldn’t afford new ones you would realize I am right to be driven. On top of this, I do enjoy my leisure time and relationships, so at the end of the day I would say I am very happy because my hard work has paid off. I have gone through 3 years of school completely debt free in part due to my hard work. I am very blessed.


&gt;You probably think that motivation and willpower are infinite, that you can just keep pushing yourself indefinitely. I can guarantee you that they are not, and when you crash you will crash hard.

You think I don’t crash? Or course I crash. Of course I’ve been suicidal and had breakdowns. And I don’t say this lightly. I’ve shut people out, and broken off relationships because of the strain. I’ve slept for 16 consecutive hours after a final before. 
But in the end it has made me a mental Titan. Nothing bothers me much anymore. I am conscious of choice, and I am conscious of what I can do to dig myself out of the occasional rutt. Diet and exercise have fixed 99% of my lingering Chemical imbalances and depression. Going to church and reading books such as Meditations helps my spirit.

&gt;I worked too hard because I felt like I had to and I completely burned myself out. You probably won't listen to me. When I was in your situation my family tried to help me but I wouldn't listen. I was bitter and completely overconfident in my abilities.

With all due respect... and I’m not trying to argue— just give you a look at my inner philosophy on sleep vs health—Do you know how I stay in shape mentally and physically? I power lift, eat healthy, and go out with friends on the weekends and play video games. I used to do Brazilian jiu Jitsu too, but THAT was my breaking point. I get adequate sleep predominantly after a heavy gym session. But I don’t sleep just because. When I’m tired I sleep, and when I have time I try and sleep A LOT. But when there is work to do and rent to pay, I make a conscious choice to get it done. Sometimes that means staying awake for 24 hours.

Arizona,"&gt;It has been a week since I last heard from them. And while I agree that that is not a lot of time in general, in an 8 week class that's 1/8 of the class time.

You're not wrong about the time-scales being more relevant on a short session course and a promise to respond within 24 hours in the syllabus DOES change things.  We're expected to honor those commitments and change them only when necessary and with good reason.  Your initial post is a bit confusing about the time lines because it seems like you're stating this all began ""a week and a half ago"" when you made the initial contact.  I'll take you at your word though that it's been a week since you last heard from them and given the syllabus promise of a 24 hour reply, that's not good.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;That's not completely True. If they are ignoring my emails intentionally, I would call that retaliatory.

That's your prerogative but the department is going to weigh whatever ""harsh"" things you said along with the TA's opinion that the matter is closed.  If the TA feels you're re-hashing the same problems, that could be consTrued as grounds to ignore your emails.  Not saying I agree or that is the case...but one of the problems with emails is you're at the mercy of the person reading it to interpret ANY ambiguities in tone or substance.  

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;That's one of the reasons why I posted here - to find out if I was making a big deal out of nothing, or if this is something that warranted escalation.

It probably warrants escalation, but not to a department chair.  The general ""chain of command"" would be TA &lt; Prof &lt; Course coordinator &lt; Faculty Administrator (this varies by department) &lt; Department chair.  Now I'm not saying you need to march it up that whole chain, certain things warrant direct escalation to a chair but usually those are things that would fall under gross misconduct that a direct supervisor would not be able to provide sufficient punishment for or outright hostile/violent behavior.  

&amp;nbsp;

In this case, it sounds like the first stop is the prof. whatever the TA has done up to this point is within his realm to provide reciprocal punishment for if its warranted.  Stated another way, the TA hasn't done anything that the prof wouldn't be able to adequately handle given his scope of options.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;
I'm not saying you're wrong about who I should talk to about my concerns, and my first preference would be to reach out to the actual tenured professor whose name is on the course. I just wanted to clear up a few misconceptions.

That's fine.  One of my principal complaints against the other prof posting here is that we DON'T have much information so suggesting you go straight to the department head is both juvenile and insubordinate.  The process exists for a reason and telling you to subvert it without any real material facts of what the core issue is could end up sending you on a path that will reflect poorly for everyone involved and one that won't get you what you need any faster...which is your course materials and answers from the TA.",0.0354,0.3747,0.5899

The best thing to do is to directly contact the prof asap. Call them if you have to. Your priority right now is not punishing the TA, it's getting access to whatever it is you need for this course. Focus on discussing material solutions not personnel problems.

Your likely first step should be to email the prof with the TA cc'd and state that you're having trouble accessing the course materials and that TA has tried to help you with this but you feel you're still missing vital material and want to get this sorted as this is short session course and you want to make the most of it.

OP admits to being ""more harsh"" than he should have.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;They emailed back repeating that there was no problem and that I should stop emailing them about this issue....they misunderstood what I said and took offense.

TA feels the issue is done, we have no way of knowing if that assessment is valid.  OP's only complaint is about accessing course materials, could be this is material is no longer relevant.  Then we have OP reading into the TA's intentions and demeanor.  Likely incorrectly.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Since then they have ignored my emails about questions about course content.

""since then"" as we have established...is 3-4 days.  That is not an inordinately long amount of time, especially if some of those days fell on a weekend, who the fuck knows because we have so little information.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;They have continued to grade my work without penalizing me for the misunderstanding.

&amp;nbsp;

Feel free to tell me where something in this rises to a level of misconduct that warrants IGNORING THE ACTUAL PROFESSOR FOR THE COURSE, IGNORING THE COURSE COORDINATOR....and skipping right to the department chair.

Point it out.  Go for it.  I'll wait.  I'm not saying OP doesn't have a legitimate grievance.  We just don't know.  There's so little information on so short a time-scale it is impossible to make that call.  It's reckless and foolish of you to encourage a student to bypass all the normal channels for handling these issues, to bypass their professor and the TA's direct supervisor to make a complaint to a department chair.

Though, the one thing a lot of kids did not consider when dropping Barrett was the study abroad. Barrett does offer study abroad perks.

If you're not someone that normally hosts events or has a solid ""squad"" to roll with, it's going to be hard to get anything off the ground, for now, just show up to things.  Putting yourself out there more is the first step.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Talking in English is not my plus, but writing is much more easier because I have time to think about what I say. So I find talking as a disadvantage.

So, I think I remember a previous post of yours where your cold open was saying something like, ""I like to talk about philosophy and deep things"".  Stop that.  Talk about FORDS (Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams, School); stay away from RAPE (Religion, Abortion, Politics, Economics).  It's difficult enough to talk about heavy subjects between two unacquainted native, fluent English speakers, when you add the assumption that one (or both) participants won't fully understand the nuance of your opinion or can't fully articulate their own ideas, it gets impossible.  Many people are also very self-conscious of their opinions because, as whole, societies are often polarized by ""deep"" issues so you could very easily be saying something super controversial in public; especially in [CURRENT YEAR].

&amp;nbsp;

Stick to light, topical talk.  This is why its WAY easier to meet people at ""interest"" events.  Go to an event for something you like or that sounds interesting to you.  You have a super easy conversation fall back, ""What got you into X"" ""What did you find harder than you thought?"" ""Any tips for beginners?"" etc etc.

ECN 312 is all partial derivatives and constrained optimizations, which is a transition that some students struggle with.

They suck *ass*, but, I'd rather not work during the school year, devote all my time to my classes (I'm taking 17 credits this semester, junior year Mechanical Engineering), and get a great GPA, at the cost of taking out loans. Yet, you're going to have to labor yourself anyway to pay for college, whether it's now, for $10.00/hr, and you're taking away valuable time from your studies which in order to attend to you are then taking away valuable time from your health, OR, you can labor yourself for $40-50/hr in just a couple years when you graduate, at the cost of a few thousands of dollars of interest on a student loan. Obviously, this isn't the best route for everybody, but I only received the President's scholarship as my financial aid from ASU, the rest were federal unsubsidized loans.

As for internships and early experience-getting, I already have an externship lined up and right now I’m in the interview process for an internship. Most firms won’t bat an eye to sophomores but I guess I got a bit lucky there.",0.531,0.4414,0.0275

Anyway OP, if you want Finance and Accounting overlap pretty throughly. I’d do that if you really want to go pure business, but what is the line of work you want to get into? Can the energy placed into a second degree be put into an internship here in the valley?

If you plan your classes right you can get around the traffic and it isn't that bad, sometimes commuting can be a real pain in the ass but it is manageable.

Whether or not you should live on tempe really depends on what type of atmosphere you want. Me personally, I would hate to live on the west campus. I don't do well in small populations so the west campus is a little too suffocating and quiet for me. Tempe always has something happening and it is always alive, I feel less isolated on the Tempe campus. But I have heard the other side to this, some people really like the west because it is like a small town and everyone kinda knows everyone. It boils down to what your  preferences are so just think real heard on what it is you look for in a community.

Arizona,"ASU does offer counseling for $15 each session but that fee can get waived if you ask! I went there over the summer and it’s pretty legit, tho when you first do the walk in appointment you may have to wait like an hour or more to see someone. So first you do the walk in to get the consultation, then on after meeting with your counselor/therapist you have something that isn’t the consultation but not a regular session (idk what it’s called), those two meetings are free. After that you start having those regular sessions with your counselor, there’s no need for a walk in after the initial consultation because every meeting afterwards will be by appointment. 

And those regular sessions are $15 each, but it’s super easy to get it waived or to ask for it to be waived, just ask your counselor and give it like two to three for it to be approved. I say it mostly likely will considering asking it for it to be waived is an indication that money is a huge factor for you and I’m sure that they want to make therapy accessible to everyone :)

It's the professors job to time manage appropriately, otherwise what's the point of even alotting a set time for the class or any class for that matter? What if this happened in the daytime and the students had more classes to attend after? It wouldn't be okay then and isn't okay in this instance either. Time management is an important skill that is emphasized to students, so it doesn't make sense for teachers to not practice it, not even just because they are teachers, but because they are grown ass adults and should know how to do that. Practically speaking, this sort of thing shouldn't be happening. Furthermore, students have lives too and sometimes can't afford to be kept for that long after the class was supposed to be over.

I've ""continued"" classes well beyond the end time but made it clear it was either optional ""this is how we did things in the real world"" material or like an extension of office hours where I'd just be catching up on my own work and grading.  You were welcome to stay and study / work on assignments while I was there for additional help.  I'd sometimes give 10m mini lectures to the whole room based on a topic question or common stumbling block.

If you stayed, did you have an advantage in the class?  Yeah sure, that's going to happen if you have more contact with the prof.  Did I introduce material that wouldn't be covered in class?  You bet your ass.  Was that material explicitly on the test?  Nope.  Would it help you on the test?  Yes.  Usually I'd order a few pizzas as well or whatever.

&amp;nbsp;

Was this ""hold"" because the prof can't manage time or because they wanted to give additional face time and/or have a review session before mid terms?

Arizona,"I can't speak for Fainekos, but I can tell you about Colbourn. He designs his class to be difficult so that he gets a wide range of grades, then curves the grades at the end of the semester. His idea is that a large range of grades is more useful than a bunch of A and B grades when determining final standings for the class. Personally, I like this method but some will not. I got a 35/50 on the first test and was told it was in A range. He posts all grades anonymously so you can see where you stand in the class compared to others. For this first test, the high was a 47 and the low was a 5.

He also posts all of the old homeworks and tests with keys so you can study them. These go back many years because he has been teaching this class for quite a while. He gives every lecture from memory and writes the lectures on the board in the front of the class. The lectures are structured around the book so you can use the book to continue on with topics he covers. The book is online for free. When talking to other people with different professors, I think Colbourn teaches the topics in the best order to help everything make sense. He uses precise language so there should be no confusion, but you must stay up to speed with definitions or you might not know what he means when he builds new definitions from old topics. The TA I have for recitation has been helpful and knows the material well. Homeworks are not graded but they help you prepare for weekly quizzes that are completed online.

TL;DR - He runs a more difficult class, partially because the topics are difficult and partially with the idea of making the final letter grades more fair through a grade curve at the end of the semester. He absolutely knows the material and will provide you with everything you need to succeed between his lectures, homeworks, and old materials from past classes.

If you get anything less than the treatment or attention you expect when you arrive for X duration, you might grow to loathe them as you made a huge sacrifice to be there. Maybe your younger brother gets married on a whim, or your dad...etc etc etc. You get what I'm saying here...


&amp;nbsp;

You sacrifice family and stay at ASU attempting to buckle down but struggle to focus on the courseload thinking, ""there's some place I'd much rather be (than getting plowed in the walk only zones)""...Hopefully you managed to stick it through without it affecting your grades, scholarship, mental health, ability to create new friends/relationships etc.


&amp;nbsp;


Either way I think it comes to you having to make a decision whole heartedly and not letting the thoughts of what could've been affect you moving forward...

Arizona,"As others have said, the projects can be quite time consuming. The requirements are pretty straight forward but actually passing all the test cases, especially in the later projects, can be difficult for some. You need to pay attention to the grammar and rules that are given as part of the assignment. All of the projects were in C++ with the exception of one which had a portion that could be written in Java. From what I've heard of others taking the class before me, the projects do change each semester so don't expect this to hold completely but it should give you a general idea. Definitely brush up on C++ if you're rusty.

In addition to programming assignments, there were also written assignments that involved the concepts he was teaching in class such as λ calculus, context-free grammars, or call by reference/value. They are not that bad (most of the problems can be worked out using the materials he provides) and he is quite willing to help you during his office hours with problems. He also stayed after each class for as long as possible to answer questions from students until he had to jet off to his next class. He uploads the notes he creates during lectures and utilizes PDFs that have detailed, and sometimes step-by-step, information on the concept he is teaching such as dynamic vs static scoping. Sometimes his lectures can be hard to follow because the concepts themselves are hard but he tries his best to ensure the class ""gets it"" as he goes along.

Misleading statistics and student loans are probably two of the biggest contributors to the problem of ""degree dilution"".  Money should not be free.  You want a loan, fine, choose a field and plan of study that has a chance of paying back that loan and maintain the grades as a condition of the loan.  Everyone is sold on the idea that degree earners make more over their lifetime than non-degree earners.  Which is True.  However if you separate the cohorts between ""degree earners"" and ""non-degree earners"" and look at the year over year earnings growth, you'll find that things roughly shake out in an 80-20 pareto split.  That is to say, it doesn't matter whether you had a degree or not, 20% of people will earn 80% of the pot among the cohort and the remaining 80% of the cohort split 20% of the pot.  If you're in that 80% that doesn't earn and you set yourself back 4 years and 60-100k in debt...well...it's a bad recipe for a future.  And the other kick in the ass?

Arizona,"Honest recommendation, if your absolutely not sure where you want to go into, but you want to still be taking classes to move forward. Take intro/ gen ed classes at a community college (if possible, in the same state so ASU go to a Phoenix CC that will transfer easily most have transfer student paths), then transfer into a major at asu later. This way you can explore interests at the community college level, spend way less money, and then be ready to dive into your main interest/major later down the road while still progressing towards a degree. If that seems overwhelming, take a semester or two off and ACTUALLY try to find things that interest you, then come back feeling a bit more prepared. There is no shame in taking a break after high school/ in general to figure stuff out. It’s expensive and takes up a lot of time lol (obviously I am biased as this is what I ended up doing out of high school, two years community, one year gap, and now I’m on a major map that I enjoy and am excited to learn about and finish, this including minimal debt and already having an associates degree under my belt!

You're going to need to provide me some sort of evidence to show me that that's even relevant to this discussion.

OP posted this: https://www.asu.edu/police/logs/October2019.pdf

The ASU PD logs for October. There is 8 charges of assault, but only one nonrelated mention of arms  in general. 

Concealed carry is not a ""protection"" and ASU's ban on concealed carry is not them lacking a protection for ""liability"" sake.

**Here are some things ASU does to provide safety:**

[Bike security, personal defense training, group classes](https://cfo.asu.edu/police-resources)

[Safety Escort](https://cfo.asu.edu/safety-escort-reservation)

The installation of blue lit poles to contact emergency services (there are always at least 2 poles in view from each other pole)

The almost constant patrolling of police officers and vehicles at all times of the night.

**Here is some information released by ASU PD:**

*""Remember to keep doors shut and locked. Do not prop doors open as this can pose a security risk. Call 911 in case of emergency.*

*Download the free ASU LiveSafe mobile app. Use emergency call boxes available on each campus that are identified by a bluepole with “Emergency” printed on it or by a bright yellow box on a metal pole. Look for the blue light directly above each pole or box at night.*

*Do not walk alone at night. Utilize the SafeWalk feature in the ASU LiveSafe mobile app or contact the Safety Escort service on the Tempe campus by calling 480-965-1515. Or, call ASU Police to ask for an escort at 480-965-3456. On the West campus, call 602-543-3456; the Downtown campus, call 602-496-3456; and the Polytechnic campus, call 480-727-3456.*

*Always remain alert and aware of your surroundings, and trust your instincts. If a situation feels unsafe, take appropriate safety precautions. Report any unusual or suspicious activity you witness. If you witness a crime, be prepared to give a full description…. Suspect(s) - Gender/Race/Hair/Approximate Age/Clothing/Weapons Vehicle(s) - License Plate/Color/Year/Make/Model/Direction of Travel If someone with a weapon demands your property, surrender it and contact police as soon as possible.*

*Report crime to ASU Police in person, by telephone 480-965-3456 or email. If you would like to report a crime but do not wish to reveal your identity, you may contact ASU Police at 480-965-3456 or 480-965-TIPS.""*",0.0603,0.5922,0.3475

Arizona,"I felt that when I took Diff EQ and Calc 3 they touched on some of the same subjects, or ways of thinking, so they made each other easier. CAD is a joke, statics will be like physics 1, and I thought physics 2 was easy. 

It's tough but doable, and it doesn't really get easier. Don't underestimate the amount of time you will need to do homework, and don't be afraid to ask for help. 

Don't feel bad if you have to take an extra semester or a few summer classes. It's very common for engineering students to take longer than 4yrs to get their degrees, I did. Nobody interviewing you for a job knows how long it took you to graduate, we only want to know that you have a legit degree and a good GPA.

* For most people, it can be extremely demotivating to study in solitude. 
   * The vast majority of people don't study if it's 100% solo, so if you can find a way to meet with other university students (ASU or otherwise) it can really help with the motivation. I personally study at cafes near my local University, or at their library (gotta break into their wifi though).
* ASU's Software courses don't have the high quality of feedback mechanisms that you may have experience on edX or Coursera. Honestly, it's pretty low tech and the lack of feedback is unacceptable in my opinion.
   * Personally I take the same course on [edX.org](https://edX.org) from other universities like UCSD, MIT, and others in parallel to ASU because their courses are much better.
* If you haven't completed all your math yet, then Professor Leonard's lectures will save you. You're Welcome.
   *  [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoHhuummRZaIVX7bD4t2czg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoHhuummRZaIVX7bD4t2czg) 
* Finally, **get really good at reading textbooks**. Learning from textbooks is an acquired skill. The more you do it, the better you get at it.
   * Textbooks are the fastest way to learn. A video lecture will take an hour to convey the same information you can read in 5 minutes, once you get good. They often convey a deeper understanding of the subject as well because they go deeper into detail.",0.6264,0.3069,0.0667

start working on your hw the day you get it. it is better for you to do it early then do it at the last minute.

if your professor uses a textbook, read a little bit ahead before you go to lecture so you have a general idea.

if you have any questions or concerns, go to the professor's office hours. don't stress too much if you do not understand something. it doesn't hurt to ask for help.

for every hour you are in lecture, you should be spending around 2-3 hours studying. this will depend on you and your ability to understand concepts.

always check the syllabus, the prof might change something during the semester and you should know what they changed.

That being said, getting an A/B in the course is pretty manageable, as Tucker provided ample opportunity for extra credit, and easy assignments/discussions were weighted pretty heavily (40% if I recall correctly) in comparison to other BIO classes (353, 360).

The first few might have some walkthroughs so they are pretty easy and helps you understand the exploit. Then it gets harder and harder.

It might be a little different now because he was having so many difficulties with people either failing or getting over 100%. I was in his first class and you needed to get to 70% on the scoreboard. As soon as you did that the next flag you get puts you on the curve. This is where competitiveness comes in. If everyone in the class wanted to be lazy and only complete 71% of the challenges, everyone would get 110% on the assignment. But in reality if you just hit the curve you usually got at least a high B or low A depending on how everyone else does.

I took 365 this semester cuz it seemed like something I’d be really interested in. Doupe is teaching to answer your question, and my god is he amazing. Hands down one of my favorite professors ever thus far. 

He’s been slowly prepping us in Linux through those bandit challenges (super basic ctf challenges with the simple commands like cat, grep, find, etc) 

I think he said near the end of the semester we’ll have some larger ctf’s on a Linux server.

I really didn’t learn much from any of the classes and have not retained much either although I did put effort into all of the classes and got A’s in them all. I’ve taken one class in person, and two online. I highly recommend online (as long as you feel you can succeed without an in person format). 

For every online class, all of the quizzes have been “open book” and there are a couple discussion boards and small papers. It’s an easy A as long as you turn all of the assignments in on time (even if you barely try). I also recommend getting a pdf or ebook for the text book so you can use ctrl f. I also don’t think the apa manual is necessary. I’ve never used mine, you mostly need to know the basic guidelines of the apa format and can easily find that information online for free.

Pro tip for anyone with Tucker though, study the hw and pre-lecture questions! Most of his exams I've taken are heavily based off of that and  sometimes he pulls them word for word. Same with his in-class clicker questions. He's a really cool dude and is obviously very passionate about Biology. He also is very generous in the sense he drops your lowest exam, a few lowest clicker questions in case you missed class, and I think also some lowest hw. He also gives a few extra credit opportunities that are very easy. I enjoy his lectures a lot and it's the only

Arizona,"I agree with /u/sankeal, at the undergraduate level, most ABET engineering programs are very similar and differ only in rigor. I'd argue ASU is one of the easier programs, but there's lots of room to apply yourself.

ASU is really big. It has hundreds of research labs where you can apply your studies and figure out if you're even interested in what your major entails. You'll spend the first 2 years taking general studies and then you get into the meat of the major... this is especially True for MSE. I spent my first two years in a great materials science lab that actually pushed me to switch to MSE from Chemical Engineering. Most people think Chemical Engineering is what MSE is (synthesizing and designing new materials, chemicals) but oh, buddy, it's not.

So it's relatively easy to get a paid research position, even from the get-go, that'll look great on your resume and help you figure out what you actually want to do. Fulton also has great programs like FURI that match you up with a professor, conduct research, help you publish a poster, and get $1500 at the end of the semester. Not to mention engineering-specific career fairs and student organizations. MSE has an org called Materials Advantage which I hear is pretty beneficial, especially with networking and getting into the industry. 

As for the classes, like I said earlier, they're not rigorous. Easy to get an A/B. Professors are relatively approachable and understanding. Ankit, a guy who teaches two critical MSE courses, was infamous for being generally insane and standoffish but he's really toned down this year. The downside of the lack of rigor is that you come away feeling like you don't have a lot under your belt, but it's easy to make up for that with research and diving deep into an aspect of materials science you like most (i.e. computation, ceramics, nanomaterials, thin films).

I think the MSE grad program is one of the best things ASU offers, tbh, but most people aren't interested in more school.",0.6655,0.2764,0.0582

No problem, also if you want to catch a great sunset, check out Hole in the Rock at Papago park. Good cap to the day after going to the Zoo or the Botanical Garden. When folks visit us from out-of-state, I always take them there because it’s harder to climb a flight of stairs than it is to hike into hole-in-the-rock. Beautiful panoramic views of the city too from that spot. In Tempe, you can never beat a stroll down Tempe town lake, or on the bridge to checkout a good sunset too. It’s a vibe. 


If you get a chance to come into to Phoenix-_proper_, I would recommend checking out the Japanese Friendship Garden(our favorite, it’s always a good time feeding Koi), Heritage Square (good evening stroll through downtown Phoenix), and get some coffee at Songbird Cafe. Also if you’re heading uptown, I’d highly recommend checking out Lux Coffee too as it’s a _mf’in vibe_ and you’ll never find another coffee shop like it.

Arizona,"Ok, so there’s a difference between being considered a dependent for financial aid and being a dependent for tax purposes. For financial aid you are considered a dependent up until the age of 24, regardless of your tax status. So, if your under 24 and your parent make a reasonable amount, your SOL in terms of aid. Once you’re 24 you can be considered independent, but in order to do so you need to provide 50% or more of your own support. So, unless your paying your mom rent and contributing to household bills your probably not going to qualify for that status while you live there either. So you have to choose.

Arizona,"EE BSE and MSE holder here. Now a EE PhD student.

I started my freshman year as a math/physics duel major. Ended up not finding MAT300 nearly as interesting as I once thought I would and I also didn't want a ""PhD or nothing"" degree (such as math and physics can be). I also recognize the irony in this considering I'm in my 2nd year of a great PhD program lmao.

Ended up researching tons of engineering majors and figured electrical was the best for me since I was always fascinated by technology and programming as well as math and physics.

Part of my choice also came down to maturity though. I was barely 17 when I was taking MAT300 and just did not care enough about school to put in the time to appreciate the beauty in it. Actually in the class now, in my 7th year of college, just to kindle that fire for fun.

I figured EE was for me since engineering degrees open up SO MANY doors to a variety of careers and electrical in particular gave me a skill set to have fun building stuff on my own time, even if I didn't pursue engineering.

Also I recognized that any technical degree was really just a degree in critical thinking with a minor in very specific vocabulary to your major. I used to joke I had a Masters in critical thinking and a minor in radio engineering.

I got two internships that were amazing experiences as an undergrad/masters student and I recognized that everyday on the job I was having FUN and getting paid for it, that's a wonderful sign.

I could go on and on about all this tbh

Arizona,"I was a former Material Science Engineering major, but switched to Biochemistry &amp; Biophysics, so hopefully I can assist with your disillusionment with the major. 

One of the challenges about freshman/sophomore year is the fact that you don't really take classes in your major to determine whether it's something you're *really* passionate about. My girlfriend (also MSE), for example, hated taking Linear Algebra/Differential Equations/Stats, but now enjoys taking the meatier classes of the major (Structures and Defects, Thermodynamics, Numerical Methods). The point of my aside is that, as of now, you're only taking classes that are the tools to succeed in the major, so it's hard to judge the entirety by just freshman classes. Look at the classes in each major map and maybe email a few professors for their syllabus to see if it's something that genuinely interests you. 

One of the things that made me realize Biochemistry was the right choice was research. Lab experience helps, in part, to elucidate the real applications of the baby concepts you learn in freshman biology/chemistry. I would also suggest reading what professors in each of these fields do (and if you're interested in their research, trying to join their group) to help validate whether that major is something you'd genuinely be interested in. 

As others have pointed out, I'd also consider the future of each major. If you major in any pure science, grad school is almost a necessity, especially in biochemistry.  If you're premed, it doesn't matter as much for your undergraduate degree (I only assume this since 80-90% of biochem majors are premed) 

If you have any other specific questions about biochemistry, feel free to PM me! I love talking about my major and chemistry in general :)",0.4445,0.4509,0.1045

However, shit like this happens.  The way I like it approached is for students to demonstrate material mastery; personally that's what I care about.  I understand language is imperfect and unfortunately sometimes you're forced to use language rather than code or notation to prompt a test question or else you'd give away too much of the answer.  Approach it showing that you understand in retrospect what the question was asking, why you interpreted it the way you did, why your answer satisfies that interpretation and also show how you would have expected the ""correct"" answer to have been prompted.

Arizona,"Personally, I am a CS major, but I’m friends with many CSE students who have recently graduated. 

1.	Both CS and CSE fall under computer science in my opinion.  There is a lot of crossover between the two degrees.  From a hiring standpoint, both CS and CSE are roughly equivalent (although CS is more widely known since it has been around longer).  A degree gets your job application past the first screening.  After that, you have to demonstrate your knowledge during an interview.  As a CS major, I don’t know nearly as much about circuits, embedded systems, or ASICs as the CSE majors I know.  That doesn’t mean I couldn’t pick it up and work in a field involving those things as a CS major though.

2.	 CSE covers most CS courses, but includes more coursework on circuits And embedded systems.  A CS major can take those courses as an elective, but most take courses on other things such as mobile app development, databases, software security, distributed systems, etc.	  

3.	 CS isn’t just coding, although it can be if that’s what you want.  I know CS and CSE majors that work in dev-ops, QA, cybersecurity, and IT.  The day to day of those four roles are quite different and none of them are just “coders”.  It really depends on what you find interesting.

4.	 They are largely interchangeable if you have the knowledge/experience applicable to the job.  CS does a bit more abstract theory (CSE355, CSE240).  CSE does more EE related coursework.  Either “gap” can be made up pretty quick once out in the workforce.  Ex: Just because you didn’t take a course on databases doesn’t mean you can’t teach yourself SQL.

Arizona,"&gt;but they actively sold her lab equipment.

Allegedly, that's part of the problem.  We have ONE side here.  Also, it is exceedingly difficult to ""sell"" lab equipment at public institutions through normal channels.  More often, a collaborating partner or funding agency buys out the interest in the equipment.  You're probably not familiar with funding structures but there's a lot here that doesn't add up if you're even vaguely acquainted with these things.  She's supposedly ""bought"" that equipment with NSF funding (What?  NSF fellowships don't provide funding for capital equipment)...but she's also suing for her tuition costs?  In most programs tuition is paid by the PI and students is only on the hook for taxes.  That doesn't add up, why is she supposedly in the small fraction of self-funded PhD students but has NSF fellowship funding which SHOULD pay out to the institute her COE (cost of education)?  I have a strong feeling that she didn't ""buy"" the equipment with her NSF funding but instead contributed to the purchase from some sponsored project account that she was given authority over but where the lion's share of the cost was paid by the lab and other sponsored project account.  I also doubt this is a case of ""we listed it on craigslist to spite her"" as the author makes it seem.

&amp;nbsp;

The description in the article doesn't make any sense from a funding / policy stand point and leads me to believe the author is wholly ignorant of how fellowships work and trying to dramatize reality.  NSF-GRFP is a 34k/yr personal stipend + 12k/yr for COE.  It's not just a slush fund you buy research materials out of.

&amp;nbsp;

Lets stop and think about this for a second.  The institute has already investigated her allegations against the PI, sided with her, and actioned him.  Yet, here she is now accusing her lab mates of retaliation and the institute has investigated that as well... and didn't side with her.  That's pretty telling interesting.",0.0287,0.2965,0.6748

We’d glance over at him a few times and he kept staring in our direction and then said “what are you looking at n*****?” We didn’t respond but 2 other girls that were there started to provoke him.

Arizona,"&gt;Arizona State University is notorious for harassment, discrimination, and retaliation. 

Do you usually just make shit up to suit your fancy?  

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Since the Professor already left, they sided with the remaining discriminators to save face.

Nothing about that logic makes any sense and you have absolutely no evidence to support it.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;During my Spring semester, my mentor teacher from Phoenix Union High School District was discriminating against me because of my former disability and being a member of the Arizona Teachers Academy (and getting my Masters). 

Yeah I'm sure that was it.  You were clearly ""discriminated"" against for being a member of a teacher's program that provides tuition reimbursement to teachers in the state.  That's a pretty historically oppressed class along with ""master's students"".  

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I even complained to ABOR, but they said go back to the University, who hired council from Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak &amp; Stewart, P.C. to conduct the ""investigation.""

So ABOR takes your claims seriously and hires a nationally recognized law firm to investigate your claims....and that is your evidence of ""notoriety"" for harassment, discrimination and retaliation...how?  Hiring outside counsel to ensure things are thoroughly investigated is now proof positive of wrongdoing?

Math builds and if you develop a deficiency the only way to keep moving on is to go back and correct that. Another problem is we tend to think of math as trivial (seems simple when your professor goes through it) and then we get frustrated when we fail our own, leading us to not even want to do it.

The real benefit is in saving time and money, the 500's you take your senior year are charged at undergrad tuition rates, and those credits count towards your bachelors, so fewer classes overall to get both degrees. Another pro as an ASU undergrad is you don't need a GRE. Downside is they cap you at 12 credits of masters level work during your senior year which sucks if you're in my position and only need one undergrad class to graduate but that's not much of a downside honestly.

As far as teaching goes, Ph.D isn't necessarily required. Lots of colleges will hire adjunct/lecturers with an MA/MS, especially if you're either a graduate of the school or are actively doing research in your field. Getting a faculty/tenure track is apparently insanely hard nowadays. The general vibe I get from a lot of people is don't chase a Ph.D unless you're either getting paid for it or if it's important to you personally as an achievement, otherwise the 5-7 years ends up not helping you much more than a masters would.

You first get a FREE kind of introductory session. You meet with one of the staff, describe your problems and they will help you find a person to talk to or in this case a group to join. Oh, and fill out paperwork.

That was only 1/3rd of your original claim.  Is that now the sole claim?  I'll let you move the goalposts that far if you'd like.  You specifically said ""former disability"".  Now I'm going to assume you didn't regrow your legs and that this disability was some sort of mental illness or would otherwise be non-apparent.  So that begs the question...why did you bring it up?  How did he find out about your ""former disability""?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;rizona State University hired a nationally recognized law firm that protects parties against claims of discrimination to investigate my claim.

Keep telling yourself that if it helps you sleep.  They're not hired to exonerate one side, they're hired because they have vast experience in this type of litigation and know the nuance of the law and what would pass the various legal tests.

Arizona,"From what I remember he was just giving the formulas which are straight up the answers for this class, no real tutorial on how to do it or use any of the functions from the single video i saw or really any talk about the excel functions in relation to the assignment. Professor Wood's (the excel) section of the CIS class is pretty hard regardless if you go or not (imo), I skipped the first few lectures because I know excel fairly well and could get through the assignments easy but when it started getting harder I started attending his lectures. Not sure how the first half of the semester went down but basically when I went there it consists of:

\- Wood lectures about excel functions and their purposes

\- Wood goes into excel assignment (our eventual homework) and does the problems legit for us

\- He usually does multiple problems at a time since they all have similar functions so not much changes so he goes to the next question

\- \*intensified talking throughout the whole class\*

\- People yell ""SLOW DOWN"" or ""YOU'RE GOING TOO FAST""

\- Wood either a) disregards the several people yelling at him to slow down or go back a problem or b) someone raises their hand and asks him to go back and he does

\- Rinse and repeat

The class is literally Wood doing the homework for us essentially (until the lectures over so not always completed), people complaining about not being able to copy it down because he's too fast, and then not paying attention until the problem is over because they missed it. The kid next to me literally said ""yeah this one is too long I'm gonna wait for him to blow it up"" (oh yeah incase him writing the literal formula before our eyes wasn't easy enough after the equation kids ask him to make the formula bigger so they can read it which i guess is for people who can't see but is really asked by the kids who were too lazy to even try reading it). It's even worse in McCarthy with the knowledge checks and kids being too slow to get the answer imo but that's a separate issue. Ultimately, I think the lazy kids just got to Wood eventually from the shouting out every answer and is flat out ignoring kids unless they raise their hand (which he's complied with every time (except once but idk if he heard the kid) but the students haven't learned I guess). It definitely doesn't help having McCarthy (the other lecturer for the class) telling kids to be selfish and shout out if they need help because it's on them if they don't get it (not as bad as it seems, was a good lesson to take responsibility). Overall, it's just sad because Wood and McCarthy are two of my favorite lecturers and it seems our class is getting to them and it's a shame because the entire class atmosphere is chaotic.

In regards to CIS hero and academic dishonesty, students will say it was a learning resource and not blatant copying but I'm pretty sure we all know that's bs. And for the kids that will complain that the school is taking away a ""learning resource"" from them, I will put money down that they have not reached out for additional resources for help from Wood or the tutoring center.

That's literally not how any of that works.  At all.  You've managed to confuse three entirely distinct legal concepts.

&amp;nbsp;

One-party consent refers to electronic ""wire tapping"" or any voice recording of otherwise private conversations.  Standing in the middle of a walkway / street is not considered a private conversation even if done in whispers.  There are some cases where a ""private"" conversation can be held in a public place, but this ain't it.  

&amp;nbsp;

""Reasonable expectation of privacy"" is the frame work that allows filming of the public or in public.  You have no reasonable expectation of privacy in a public place.  A place of public accommodation (store, restaurant, mall, whatever) can at any point revoke your permission to film on their property and if you refuse to stop you can be trespassed.

They constantly say failure is a good learning experience. Which it is mind, but back in their day, you can take a risk in starting a business. If you fail, you still get to keep your house. To get any sort of competitive advantage in this day, you have to risk it all unless you are rich/have a large pool of money behind you. Failure is a lot more permanent.

If you feel especially confident because your high school experience and you have retained the material, then you can try it and you'll likely do well. Personally, chemistry was much easier for me.

Calc 3 and discrete math have very little in common. MAT 243 was an unconventional math class and you will not lose anything from taking a break from calc. I would highly recommend taking MAT 243 now regardless of any other decision because it is a prerequisite for 310, which is a prerequisite for everything else.

Arizona,"I just want to voice out my opinion that I want your (people who eat meat and are okay with people fighting for animal rights) feedback on how you'd want protestors to protest. 

In my opinion, 

Asking people to care about humans first and animals next or LGBT first and animals next is downplaying the whole point of a targeted protest. It doesn't invalidate or deny that those aren't issues. There are people covering those issues as well. Doesn't mean, people shouldn't protest for  equal wages in the US simply because theres a genocide happening in the East. This is whataboutism. 

I understand that the messages they carry are harsh, invoking guilt and can irritate meat eaters.  But a protest always holds signs to get strong messages across. There are plenty who do it from a sense of moral superiority and to look down upon others, but there are those who genuinely feel that the act of killing animals is murder. 

Should these messages be laid out different? I'm asking from a sincere view point, being a vegetarian myself and wanting to make a real difference. I understand that the shift is hard and there is a lack of alternatives. I'm currently dependent on dairy myself and know how hard it is to go vegan. I sympathize with meat eaters as I can understand how hard it is to give it up. 

I dislike vegans who torment people in actual restaurants while people are having a meal. I'm not for that stuff. But I feel like the vegan movement gets a lot of unwarranted hate. Am I wrong?",0.0239,0.2428,0.7333

Arizona,"CIS major here! Currently in my junior year! Question is your major CIS or SCM? Your tag says SCM? 

Well I've got bad news and good news for you. 

Bad news: CIS as a major is very very broad in my opinion. CIS 235 is VERY VERY easy compared to the rest of the classes in the major. If you can't get at least a B+ in this class I would suggest switching to another major. In your junior year you will need to learn Javascript and SQL at the same time. This is very difficult for most students.  

Good news: If you're doing well that's a good sign! Near the end of the year you will learn a little python and SQL so pay attention to there. Another bit of good news is that CIS is a fairly easy major especially compared to CS or CSE, and is a good major to pick.  If you are looking to double major in SCM and CIS then that's a pretty good idea. I know lots of students that are doing that so you could be successful in that!",0.7575,0.1999,0.0427

Arizona,"&gt;I say this as someone who has received NSF (and other) grants, many researchers produce ""absolutely nothing of economic merit"" even if they make the relevant pitch in the NSF grant proposals. And they get federally subsidized.

It's intellectually dishonest to place congressionally pre-appropriated funds for research endeavors that are competitively awarded in the same basket of individual entitlements as social welfare, subsidized loans, and tax-payer funded healthcare.  The taxes collected to fund NSF monies are not a result of an individual's choices to assume debt AND those monies are provided to an individual expressly to seek advanced training in a field that IS deemed of economic value.  It's not the National Social Justices Foundation for a reason.

&amp;nbsp;



&amp;nbsp;

&gt;OP may actually just want to benefit the indigenous populations through his education.

Good for him.  Indigenous populations aren't called ""nations"" for no reason.  He can seek monies from their programs if he wants to advance their agendas.  Social justice is not the same as anthropology, history, arts that benefit a people (and by extension society as a whole) through rigorous preservation and documentation of culturally significant materials.  This is literally creating new policy, doctrine, or arguments to advance their interests.    

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;Are you saying that's a bad thing?

There are plenty of good things that federal tax-payers shouldn't be paying for and should either be the realm of the states, individuals, or private capital.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Public benefit comes in many forms, not just economic.

Agreed.  But the reality is loans are quantifiable.  This is an entirely different debate but I honestly believe ""easy credit"" and the rapid expansion of debt markets is generally what precipitates financial collapses; at least that's proven True for the past 4.  Don't misunderstand me, I don't like federal student loans as a policy in general regardless of the program.  However I especially don't like the idea of the federal government using the monies of people with less earning potential (non-college grads) to fund college educations for people that have a 50% higher chance (~15-17% vs 10-12% depending on which study you look at) of ending up in default than their peers.",0.0936,0.4122,0.4942

I had no experience coding before coming into CIS. It wasn't an easy journey, but it was manageable. Your first few coding classes are aimed at if you have no idea what coding is, or what even an IDE is, so those classes do a good job at getting you caught up to speed. 

I actually chose CIS over CS because of its lack of math, so the math classes stopped for me at the 200 level (which I strongly advise you to completely your brief calculus at a community college). 

I got a certificate in BDA and its actually the focus of my career and jobs I've been applying to. Stats are not that horrible as most of the statistics you have to do are done by programs (WPC 300 uses JMP and Excel for stats), but there is a 200 level class where you do stats by hand. 

I can say that finance is pretty math and formula heavy. I wouldn't say its super hard, but theres a lot of numbers you'll have to apply formulas to. As CIS, you take 1 finance class.

For WP Carey majors, math is SUPER watered down. I took AP calc 1 in HS as well and did terrible, got a 1 on the AP exam itself. I took brief calc last year and got an A+. In my business analytics class I'm currently on-pace for an A/A+. Next year will be business stats (final math class) for me, which will probably be the most challenging in terms of math classes.  For whatever WP Carey major you choose, you won't have to be a wiz at math. I despise math as a whole and nor am good at it, but thoroughly enjoy accounting!

For a class like Calc 3, I feel like the homework ideas should be similar to the test ideas (correct me if this assumption is wrong). So understanding the homework, means success on the tests. I think the pitfall of many students is confusing the idea with completing homework with understanding homework. If you cannot go back and redo the homework problems you've completed, you do not understand what's really going on. Looking at guides, getting tutoring, even cheating on homework is fine for a competition grade...but in the end, you need to go back and study ""why"" and ""how"" you got the solution from the information you started with. 

My last tip is...study efficiently. You say no matter how much you study, nothing clicks. How much time are you spending on studying without distractions, how often do you do this? Studying with the game on in the background is not studying, studying while messaging your friends is not studying. For me, I average about 2 hours a day studying on my single math class.

That being said, the upper division CS courses will not only require you to have a good understanding of the coding concepts learned in the classes you've already taken, but they will also require you to be very proficient in higher-level math, mainly the types of things you encounter in Discrete Math.

Starting this class as a complete beginner is actually great fun because you’ll improve drastically over the course of an entire semester. Throwing is mostly muscle memory and you’ll pick it up fairly quickly. I went in also hardly knowing anything about ceramics and came out of it with a new lifelong hobby.

Regardless of your personal / political views on it.  Legally, the consensus is that DACA is a ham-fisted executive action that didn't respect state law, or shockingly, established federal law.   It puts everyone in a weird conundrum and forces legal showdowns between states and the federal government.

&amp;nbsp;

At the core of the AZ Supreme Court case will be one question, ""Is it fair or lawful that illegal immigrants with a stay of action (weird, but reality.  Entered illegally, allowed to stay federally, state doesn't consider them lawfully present) pay less in tuition at a PUBLIC AND FEDERALLY FUNDED US school than US citizens regardless of the citizen's state of origin?""  The likely answer is no as ABOR has effectively violated the wellform reform act by creating a public benefit that not only incentivizes immigration but is ONLY available to immigrants.

#FAQ

#What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

#Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

•	⁠Rudeness towards other Redditors,
•	⁠Spreading incorrect information,
•	⁠Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

#Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

#I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

#How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",0.0318,0.2783,0.69

In this case it would be an upgrade for 1 term at $19.99. So they still get their money, but if you end up taking another course that is another $100, you technically get it for $19.99 (plus tax). The kicker, though, is this offer usually lasts around 2 weeks. But when your subscription is 30 days from its expiration, it will give you the option to renew and they offer 6 months at $119.99.

Lifesgood10 made a lot of good points about quality of life and amenities. They list the honors credits, human event, and thesis as the cons, but I definitely don't agree with that.

You can get a lot out of Barrett even though it is extra work. I completed my honors credits exclusively through contracts which served two purposes; it cut down the number of classes I had to take, and it helped me get to know my professors better. I worked really hard on my projects, and my professors remembered me when I came back to them for letters of recommendation.

One of my honors contract projects developed into my thesis, and I can't begin to tell you how much I got from writing my thesis. I include it on my resume, and it was a factor in getting an amazing internship with Charles Schwab and in getting into my ASU grad program. I don't know how much other students generally write since I didn't know any other Barrett students, but I wrote 20 single spaced pages of content (29 w/ images, graphs, and APA format reqs). Because major program required a capstone class, my school allowed me to submit my thesis as my final capstone project which cut down my work in my last undergrad semester.

I also took advantage of grad school classes. The only thing I really wanted to do but didn't have time for was Project Excellence. Barrett undergrads can take classes at the ASU Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law (on the DT campus). They have some interesting topics, but it never fit into my schedule.

1. Surrounded by good students and people with unique hobbies and interests. I’ve met twitch streamers, film makers, musicians, writers etc.
2. Early registration for classes, this allows you to get good professors as their classes fill up within a few hours sometimes. 
3. Access to Human Event and honors classes. As an electrical engineer for example I will be taking an honors course about the social impact of clean energy. This will allow me to develop my interest in renewable energies. 
4. The honors thesis will be a good chance to innovate or just do whatever the hell I want, that’s pretty cool in my opinion. 
5. Better dining hall and facilities - the hype is True
6. Some prestige in the name, how much is debatable.
7. Honors contracts allow you tailor your learning experience a little bit. I will be making a pong game in my programming class for example, outside of the regular old specified assignments.

Cons 
1. $1,000 a year
2. Forces you to get honors credits, take the human event, and do a thesis.

I am biased because I come from the middle class and haven’t had to work for college tuition. But I believe that the $4000 cost for four years is really not that much money in the long run.

The Barrett dorms are a bit nicer than the average dorm on campus and the dining hall is nicer, but they’re more expensive because of that. There’s a 1000$ fee per semester just to be in Barrett. You will have to take the human event part 1 and 2, and complete a certain amount of honors credits, which can be achieved by taking honors classes or completing honors “contracts” in normal classes that offer them.

No, I'm not saying that.  I'm saying his mother is going to have to fight that public image that is literally what's being published.  Prep school graduate sports business major OD'd in his frat room.  It doesn't take a logical leap to say that doesn't paint a flattering picture, hence why articles like the OPs are being published to give the kid some definition.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;In my opinion you are looking for a cop out (fentanyl) as if people go from smoking a joint to taking pills that kill them without a major step in between.

Happens all the time.  People take their first pills when someone tells them its just molly, garden variety xanax or something and later that night they're fatally hypoxic in agonal respiration, choking on their own vomit, and have a heart rate approaching elevator music BPM.

My dorm in hassay was literally the exact same model as my sisters when she went to school elsewhere but her rates were a lot cheaper and rooms weren’t shared.  Even so, those circumstances are slightly tolerable, but I really couldn’t stand the hiring system taking place, specifically for the CA’s. It was a luck of the draw of getting terrible, Lazy CA’s vs getting good ones. In my first dorm room before I moved out due to lousy roommates, the CA’s on that floor were extremely inattentive and let whatever go on no matter what time of the day. They clearly only cared about one thing when they applied and it was the free housing. Whereas when I moved to my new dorm, the CA’s were extremely active on what’s going on in the floor and constantly popped in to see how everyone was doing and sometimes offering free goodies. And this is important because I’ve visited different buildings and you can tell when CA’s didn’t care because their floors were constantly dirty and smelled of weed and garbage, whereas with my second group of CA’s the entire floor was calm and relatively clean. 

As for Vista, the only incentive on living there is that you were walking distance from Walmart. Now that its closed, the only reason to live there is if you don’t have a car and need to be close to campus. Prices spike from 3600 to nearly 5000 if you want to switch to a private bedroom from a shared one. Even if you decide to live in a shared bedroom to save money and don’t have a roommate, they perform unannounced inspections (even during breaks Incase you’re out of town) to make sure you don’t take up most of the space. They want to make sure you literally pay for your side of the room and that space only or you get fined. As for everything else, the appliances get cheaper and cheaper as you get more roommates (I noticed this when I went from a 4 to a 2 person apartment), and most of them were faulty. Also be warned, the A/C won’t work depending where the unit is from your room because they place it in oddball places where the air can only travel to the rooms closest to it, which is perfect during the hot summer months and moving in.",0.1137,0.4576,0.4287

Eh debatable.  The type of actions endorsed by BDS are not anti-semitic in a vacuum.  However, whether the movement itself is anti-semitic depends on WHY you're engaging in BDS.  The author is fundamentally arguing that the grounds for the current BDS movement are built upon lies and propaganda to give the movement a veneer of legitimacy and social justice that's appealing to western liberals.  When, in his assessment, BDS is just garden variety anti-semitism being masked by Arab backed propaganda efforts to make BDS ""woke"".  He also engages in a few whataboutisms to call out hypocrisy.

Arizona,"Part 2

&gt;I later learned about another initiative designed to alienate Jewish students. The ASU chapter of [Students for Justice in Palestine](https://www.statepress.com/article/2019/11/spopinion-asu-clubs-should-sign-pro-palestine-bds-resolution) is ""encouraging student clubs to sign a BDS resolution,"" because it’s obviously important that the Chess Club and Badminton Club weigh in on an international conflict. 

I fail to see how this alienates Jewish students at ASU.  Regardless if it's members of a Chess Club or Badminton Club, they presumably Americans who through their First Amendment rights can choose  to boycott anything they wish.  In my own personal view, I support BDS because the right-wing government in Israel is dead set on expansion and the direct or indirect removal of non-Jews from the land Israel militarily controls.  I'm not going to spend a dime to further that cause.

&gt;ASU has historically been a safe and welcoming university for all its students. It’s why I decided to involve myself in social clubs and further continue my education. ASU is not a place for blind hate, and I think it’s important to recognize that our issues are few and far between.

I agree that the anti-Semitic flyers are totally out of line.

&gt;However, the recent uptick in anti-Semitic activity is concerning. With the [growing cases](https://www.adl.org/resources/reports/schooled-in-hate-anti-semitism-on-campus) of anti-Semitic activity permeating college campuses across the country, the ASU administration needs to address all forms of anti-Semitism, right wing and left wing. 

Sure. I'm in agreement.

&gt;I have faith that the student body will recognize this BDS initiative for what it is, blatant anti-Semitism, and that these incidents are just a small blip in an otherwise bright future.

This is where I totally disagree.  Equating BDS with antisemitism is basically saying that because you would like to see a two-state solution, when the right-wing Israeli government is doing everything it can to make sure one will never arise, supporting BDS means you're doing it because you have an irrational hatred of Jews.

So I'm pretty sure I've opened a can of worms so to say, but I'm completely willing to have a discussion.",0.0614,0.381,0.5576
Arizona,"I believe that the author of this article is quite passionate about this topic and I do not fault him for it, however I want to start this counter-piece with the Anti-Defamation League's (the leading advocacy group fighting antisemitism) definition for the term.  They define it as:

&gt;The belief or behavior hostile toward Jews just because they are Jewish. It may take the form of religious teachings that proclaim the inferiority of Jews, for instance, or political efforts to isolate, oppress, or otherwise injure them. It may also include prejudiced or stereotyped views about Jews.

I agree with the first part of the definition, however it's important to note (and its not a semantic argument) that the existence of antisemitism is not necessarily the belief or behavior hostile to Jews, the existence of antisemitism is the reason behind the belief or behavior.  It's important to keep in mind that when you are accused of being an anti-Semite, you're being accused of hating Jews just because they are Jewish.  The key part of the second clause is the word ""MAY.""  What follows are examples where antisemitism may occur, not that such actions in themselves are automatically anti-Semitic.

&gt;In fact, why is it that the world’s only Jewish state faces such libelous abuse when students don’t consider boycotting China for their [treatment](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2019-09-30/how-china-sees-hong-kong-crisis) of Hong Kong, Syria for [murdering](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/world/middleeast/syria-chemical-attack-ghouta.html) their own citizens, or Iran which is the No.1 [state sponsor](https://www.rferl.org/a/u-s-state-department-iran-remains-world-s-worst-state-sponsor-of-terrorism-/30248755.html) of global terrorism? The answer is clear: It’s anti-Semitism.

When statements like this are made, it raises my eyebrow slightly because in my opinion the author is stating that unless you use the same amount of energy protesting the various atrocities listed, you must be anti-Semitic (meaning you hate all Jews just because they are Jewish).  That sort of rationale never really flew with me.

&gt;While anti-Semitism runs rampant in far right circles, ever-prevalent anti-Semitism from the left is completely ignored underneath a guise of human rights. When discussing human rights, why don’t we document the [atrocities of Hamas](https://www.businessinsider.com/gaza-violence-hamas-role-israel-embassy-us-2018-5) designated as a terrorist organization by the [United States](https://web.archive.org/web/20050511025028/http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/45394.htm) and the [European Union](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32017D0154&amp;from=EN)?

In this passage, I think it's important to define our terms.  In this case the term ""terrorism."" What is interesting about this term is that it would appear that different agencies have completely different definition as to what constitutes terrorism.  A while back, the international community sat down to come up with a definition that everyone would agree on.  The most interesting part of this collaboration is that they were only able to come up with a working definition because they had a hard time defining the term in a way that would exclude actions committed by the United States.  Believe it or not, the determining factor in the presence of terrorism was not the actual act itself, but who committed it.  It was defined in way to where only non-state actors were capable of committing terrorism.  To put it another way, if Israel and Hamas carried out the same action, in Israel's case, it would not be considered terrorism because they are a nation state.  It would be considered terrorism in the case of Hamas because they are a non-state actor.

It is for these reasons that I consider the term ""terrorism"" to be a political term applied to military operations carried out by non-state actors.  The term is great for propaganda purposes, but when you dive deeper it really doesn't mean anything.

&gt;Hamas indiscriminately launches thousands of rockets into Israeli civilian population centers [from hospitals](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4548760,00.html), expecting Israel to respond as any other sovereign nation would, with force. The [Palestinian Liberation Organization](https://www.adl.org/resources/glossary-terms/palestine-liberation-organization-plo) continues to[ subsidize the families of terrorists](https://palwatch.org/page/15217) who stab and kill innocent Jews. 

Hamas (whatever you think of them... and I don't have high praise for them) is legally under occupation according to International Law.  A lot of people will argue that since Israel removed their population from Gaza the occupation no longer exists, but that is not True.  An occupation exists when the residents have no control of their airspace or seaports.  What many people fail to mention, or are just unaware of, is that the decision to remove the settlers from Gaza was not done in good faith.  The PM at the time was under great pressure and made the calculated decision to carry out the evacuation in order to focus on West Bank settlements which were more important due to their natural resources.

&gt;BDS paints the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a one-sided issue and fails to consider Israel’s numerous attempts at peace. When Israel [disengaged](https://mfa.gov.il/MFA/AboutIsrael/Maps/Pages/Israels%20Disengagement%20Plan-%202005.aspx) from Gaza in 2005, forcibly removing thousands of its own citizens in order to trade land for peace, Israelis were immediately met with rocket fire from the coastal enclave.

I addressed this in the previous excerpt comment.  

&gt;Antisemitism exists in many forms. ASU recently experienced an example of white supremacist anti-Semitism this week. A “[Love Not Hate](https://www.newsweek.com/nazi-group-posts-recruitment-fliers-swastikas-around-campus-arizona-state-university-1470258)"" poster appeared on campus with a swastika replacing the “O” in Love and a Jewish star replacing the “A” in Hate. 

If I find out who did this please rest assured a severe ass kicking is in their future (Krav Maga/Pankration Fighter Here).

Absolutely do not choose the 2nd floor in Best C, as they continued to have flooding on that floor due to water pooling on ledges on the outer part of the building when it would rain. I had two friends that were one of many who ended up having to move elsewhere because there were puddles of water on their floor and whenever a maintenance request was filed they would send a guy with a wet-vac to suck up the water and were told it would probably happen again. As others have mentioned any mailboxes and studio rooms will be located in Best C. Best C also includes washers and dryers on each floor whereas Hayden East and West do not so you are then forced to walk over to Best C to use a larger community laundry room. Hayden South also has laundry units, however, like others have said the rooms are laid out really strange and there are no elevators. Alternatively, however, the Hayden West rooms and probably East (I haven't been inside East) are larger than the rooms in Best C, but you do have to walk outside in order to get to the bathrooms and they are significantly worse than the community bathrooms in Best, and commonly don't have hot water. If you do decide to choose Hayden East or West I would definitely recommend the 3rd floor as they have higher ceilings and large windows. The other option I would recommend for Best C is there are annex structures on the 2nd and 3rd floors that include the same layout as Hayden East and West and although you still have to walk outside for a second you would walk across the ""hall"" to go inside Best C and use the bathrooms inside on those floors.",0.0914,0.4558,0.4528

The third floor of both from I think it’s 301-310 all have really nice big wall windows. The rest all have one smaller window. All Haydens have Ac that is controllable while Best A and B do not, I believe only a select few in Best C do. Hayden south is probably the worst when it comes to wanting something big as it’s configured weird and is a longer room compared to the others that are square.

Arizona,"I would certainly go to the meeting to discuss it with them. Bring the scratch paper if possible. When you are there, I would ask for clarification as to exactly what they are accusing you have doing that amounts to cheating. I know you say here that you believe it's because you looked away from your screen, but I'd recommend you ask them to explain the accusation rather than putting forth your believed reason.

Additionally, if what you said turns out to be exactly what they're accusing you of- I would ask them to consider the fact that  you did conduct a room sweep which should also be on the video and should confirm that there is not a computer monitor there. Certainly stress the fact that looking off screen alone is not an academic integrity violation and that if that is the entire basis for the accusation, it would be ridiculous to find you in violation.

In the case that they determine that you did commit an academic integrity violation, appeal it ASAP. If you file an appeal in a timely manner, the sanction will not be put into effect before the appeal is resolved. Also, you're not going to get expelled- stop worrying about that. If this is your first violation, especially one that is built on such a weak basis, the worst you're going to get is an XE grade for the course. More likely would be a failing grade for the exam- however if you explain the issues with the basis of this to the academic integrity people, they will hopefully agree that it is not sufficient.

One thing that I will note, is that the notice of investigation does not get sent out until the integrity officer determines that there is a sufficient basis for an integrity violation investigation to occur. Since they are lacking evidence, your professor or they may ask you for your side or may try to get you to admit to cheating- don't do it. Stick to the facts that all you did was look off screen and that the room sweep showed that there was no monitor.

Arizona,"You are getting way in front of yourself here. RP Now picked up something on your exam and the recording was sent to the Dean's office. The person in charge of academic integrity (Joe V.) also saw the same thing which looks like a violation and that generated the letter. 

Now you are being given a chance to explain yourself and I URGE you to do it. I know Joe V. quite well and he is a fair and reasonable guy. Joe can either dismiss the incident (if you can persuade him) or can suggest a penalty ranging from a warning up to, in very bad /repeat offenses, expulsion. If you have not done anything wrong before and if this is a fairly minor situation, you are probably looking at a warning or a zero on the exam. If it is more significant, you could get a zero on the exam and a full letter grade drop on your final score. If it is truly bad or repeat, you could get an XE or suspension from WPC or expulsion from ASU. I have seen every single one of these punishments enacted. 

So, if the situation is exactly as you describe and you don't have any previous offenses, you will almost certainly be on the lighter side of the punishment.

Once you get the punishment from Joe V., you can appeal it to the WPC Academic Integrity committee which can dismiss the incident or decrease OR INCREASE the punishment. You can then appeal it to the Dean and then to the Provost. All can dismiss, decrease or increase the punishment. 

In your meeting, be aware that notes are being kept and so make sure that you are fully telling the truth about what happened. Nothing pisses Joe V. and the various committees off as much as someone who lies and then gets caught in the lie. If you lie and are caught, it will almost certain increase the punishment.

It does have studios, but they allow students to explore different branches of design a little bit more, and is therefore less rooted in architectural design. 

I graduated from the undergraduate architecture program in 2017, and cannot say enough great things about it. The program is intense, but very very worth it. 

Please feel free to PM me if you have further questions about the program or architecture in general!

ETA: You can definitely build a portfolio with either program. The content will just be different! If you definitely want to become licensed, an architecture bachelors will give you a leg up.

My freshman year, I parked in Lot 59. In the few days between dorm move-in and class, I left my truck there with the sunshade in the windshield (August in AZ).

Another time, I was not so lucky. As many of you know, during home games, they make you move your car out of Lot 59. At the time, you could either move it into Gammage (Lot 3) or Lot 20 (now gone, where the retirement home is being built). I chose Lot 20 this particular time.

So later on I make my way to my truck to move it back to Lot 59, and it won't turn over. Dead battery. It was a Sunday, and IIRC, ASU PTS didn't come out and jump dead batteries on Sundays. Either way, I left my truck there and promptly got a non-negotiable ticket. My fault, but still frustrating.

Even then, plenty of terrorists made their resistance formal and codified in manifestos like the Declaration. Osama bin Laden did it, even the New Zealand Mosque shooter did it. This doesn't make an act not terrorism and it doesn't automatically justify it either, the argument in the manifesto is important.

There was plenty of action against civilians as evidenced by the large waves of Loyalist refugees that left for Canada and other British colonies. Not to mention trading and feathering which was the calling card of the Revolution at the time.

Arizona,"No, but certainly possible. If you read the link I provided above you can find more details.

Arizona,I did not attend a criminal court earlier today.,0.0109,0.3369,0.6522
Arizona,"""Confiscated""? They're not the police and they can't just take your property from you. Don't help them in their investigation as you have the advantage of being presumed innocent of the violation if you appeal.",0.0238,0.3272,0.649
Arizona,"So if the appeal is denied, will higher punishment be inevitable?",0.0071,0.4289,0.5639
Arizona,"Did you find out exactly what they were accusing you of doing that amounts to cheating? Also, did they explain why they were taking the scratch paper as evidence since scratch paper was allowed on the exam?

On to your appeal- here's how it works.
You will be notified of your right to appeal to the dean. You have 10 days from the time of that notification to submit your appeal, which must include certain details.

This will then result in a private hearing, which will essentially be like a court case between your professor and you. However, there is some good news-

1. You are allowed an ""advisor""- this could be a trusted friend, a lawyer, a faculty member who is on your side, ect. They cannot address the people at the hearing, but they speak directly to you.

2. You are presumed innocent. The instructor must prove it ""more likely than not"" AKA 51 percent, that you did commit an academic integrity violation. All evidence must be presented during the hearing and the instructor leads 

Before you go forward with an appeal- you need to really consider how strong of a case you believe that the school has. Appealing is risky, because the appeal board could issue a stronger punishment than just a zero for the exam. Also, while it may sound like a high burden of proof, 51 percent is very low. Another way to read this is that they can be 49 percent sure that you didn't cheat, but still issue you a sanction.
You may wish to cut your losses and accept the zero and move on. 

However, if you believe that the instructor does not have a strong case and that they will not be able to demonstrate even the slightest hint of a possible academic integrity violation and you decide to move forward with the appeal, read all of this https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity/policy - specifically sections D, E, F, G, and H.

If I was in your shoes, I would be examining the instructor's claim and evidence from their perspective. Does it even remotely look like an academic integrity violation? Do I have concrete, physical and demonstrable proof that no violation occurred? If the answers are yes and no, respectively, I wouldn't appeal due to the risk of receiving a higher sanction.",0.0953,0.5711,0.3336

&amp;#x200B;

And no, appealing it will not make them put more punishments on you. They already think you cheated, thus, gave you zero. Appealing and losing doesn't mean you cheated again, or they were able to prove you cheated 101%. 

Appeal it. They do not have an evidence against you. The only think they are standing on is that you looked away which is normal for someone sitting on a chair for 60 minutes or more.. 

And an education lawyer will help you more. And If I were you, I would not hesitate to get a lower, because they absolutely have no proof against you. 

&amp;#x200B;

And remember, you have 10 days to appeal. You can appeal it by emailing the person who sent you the email requesting an appointment first time.

My advice on right now? Do your best to pass. If you fail, you can retake it with Celestian and replace the grade! I also struggled with Johnson’s class but, especially if you are CS, there are classes that are WAY, WAY more difficult and HARDER to understand than Johnsons class.

 Steps for Appealing an Allegation of an Academic Integrity Violation
If you wish for the W.P. Carey School of Business’ Student Academic Affairs Committee to hear your appeal of a violation against Arizona State University’s academic integrity policy or to appeal the applied sanction, you must first send a statement of intent to appeal to the Assistant Dean of Academic Affairs, Dr. Joseph Van Orden (joseph.vanorden@asu.edu). In memo format, your statement must provide the following information:
 Your name and ASU ID number
 The course number and name, the term, year, and session in which the course was
taught (in example, SCM 300, Global Supply Operations, class 56789, Spring 2017 – C
Session)
 The instructor’s name
 Your account of the events that transpired
 The outcome you are seeking from the committee
 Your handwritten signature at the bottom of the document
If you have documentation or evidence of any kind to assist with you with your case and support your statement, please submit them per the following:
 Label them as Exhibit 1, Exhibit 2, etc.
 Reference the exhibit numbers in your statement of appeal so the Committee will know
what each exhibit supports and is referenced to
 Submit along with your statement of appeal
Once you have submitted your statement of intent to appeal along with any supporting documentation or evidence to Dr. Van Orden, you will be contacted to schedule an in‐person meeting with our office to discuss the appeal process itself and answer any questions you may have concerning it.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding your responsibilities in starting an appeal, feel free to contact the Office of Academic Affairs at 480.727.4563 or by email (robertbillings@asu.edu).",0.037,0.8673,0.0957

Arizona,"&gt;your first link doesn't include athletics

it does.  Athletics is classed under ""instruction and academic spending"", the biggest part.  The pdf download confirms it

&gt;pac-12 are self sufficient

the NCAA definition for self sufficient does not mean it isn't being paid for by your tuition.  It simply means it *claims* that it makes more money for the school than it spends.  I realize it was two paragraphs before and so it couldn't easily be ctrl+f'd but you probably shoulda double checked.

meeting that standard of ""self sufficient"" is hilariously easy to fake, due not just to a million different loopholes but also NCAA regulations regarding student athlete compensation, the abuses of which are gratuitously well documented

&gt;you can opt out of

and which, if the athletics department was *actually* self sufficient and not simply a money-sink, wouldn't exist to need to be opted out of, to say nothing of how opt-out is a scam and it should be opt-*in* instead.

You can see the symptoms of how not self sufficient the athletics program is at the school in literally all of the penny pinching that goes on.  If income from athletics was actually higher than what was spent on athletics, that money would go to non-athletic spending to benefit the school, its employees, and its students.

Sometimes when you’re backed up the last step gets half assed. Sometimes people grab the silverware before it’s been hosed off.

You can do walk-ins but it could take awhile depending on the time/other things going on. They will always prioritize students in immediate distress. The counselors here are licensed counselors with the same credentials that you would find at an off campus service for counseling. Most licensed counselors and are not psychiatrists and they don't need to have a PhD. Psychiatrists are medical doctors that would diagnose specific mental illness and prescribe and manage medication but don't typically do therapy. From looking at their website it doesn't seem like Counseling Services have a psychiatrist on staff, but I could be wrong.

The two major complaints I've heard from students regarding counseling is that 1. They feel like they're being referred off and 2. They don't connect with their counselor. For the referral piece ASU is a big school with a lot of people so unfortunately this is probably often a reality because they simply don't have the staff to provide service to everyone. I do know students who have been able to see counseling services more consistently because they didn't have any other options and I would suggest making that clear if that's your situation. However I also don't think it's a bad thing to seek service off campus if it's a better fit for you.

As far as not connecting with your counselor unfortunately that's often the struggle of counseling. As someone who's been trying to find a therapist for years it can be really hard to find a person you connect with and feel comfortable with. You can see information on all the staff online ( [https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling/providers](https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling/providers) ) which indicates their areas of interest/specialty and you can also see pictures of them. It's hard to find someone but don't be afraid to just be honest and say you need someone else.

Another wonderful resource that I personally support is the Counselor Training Center ([https://cisa.asu.edu/graduate/ccp/ctc](https://cisa.asu.edu/graduate/ccp/ctc) ) These are students that are doing clinical work but are being supervised by a licensed professional. For full time students and staff you only pay $20 a semester for consistent weekly meetings with your counselor. I personally tried it for the first time this past semester and had a wonderful experience. It was the first time I truly felt connected with my counselor but again it's kinda luck of the draw here. The super nice thing about this service is that it is super consistent and super affordable, which is what I personally needed.

My final piece of advice as someone who has sought out mental health resources and also frequently helped students do this: Make sure to advocate for yourself. I know it can be incredibly difficult especially when dealing with mental health concerns. If you're meeting with someone that is not helping and even causing more harm you need to meet with someone else. Most people who go into this field are there because they want to help people so you won't offend them by telling them how you need to be helped. And if you're in a place where advocating for yourself is challenging or you don't feel like you're not being heard please ask for help from someone you trust at ASU. Again most people working in education generally are in the field because they want to help students (at least I hope!) If you don't have someone you trust DM me, I'll meet with you and help you navigate. Asking for help and advocating for yourself can be incredibly difficult things to do but it will make a difference.",0.1044,0.4647,0.4309

The dichotomy is not between ""True"" science and soft science. It's between hard science and soft science. This is based on how the scientific method is used.

You realize biology is considered a soft science right? It's also measured largely on subjective characteristics. This does not mean it is not a science; which is different from your initial statement.

Arizona,"&gt;You just spent the majority of your responses arguing that logic is a minor part of computer science and ends at conditional statements and then proceeded to attempt to highlight how logic is more applicable to moral arguments, things which are inherently subjective.

I was arguing that throughout a CS degree the courses that teach the most transferable skills related to making and defending an argument are probably discrete math and computing ethics for the reasons I stated above. 

Nowhere in any of my posts did I say that logic is a minor part of computer science... You can't quote it because it literally doesn't exist. 

Also, logic is definitely used in making moral arguments. Just because there are subjective qualities in a moral argument does not mean that you cannot have a consistent system of logic to get you from premise to conclusion. For somebody that did research in T H E    F I E L D     O F   L O G I C  you should probably understand this very fundamental concept.

You've demonstrated atrocious reading comprehension, a terrible understanding of the types of strong claims you should be making with your background, and just a general sense of incompetence when it comes to having a back and forth dialogue.

I know what computational thinking is. It's pretty much irrelevant when it comes to interpreting and constructing arguments. There's a few similarities, but most of the transferable skills are much more effectively learned through a writing course. I'd be interested in hearing you clearly state how exactly you think computational thinking helps you form cogent arguments. 

&gt; Also, literally no one brought up calculus. It's not even relevant... It's not even a science.

I brought up calculus as it's a course all engineering students take. I was poking fun at the naivety that engineering courses give you the background to adequately write off entire fields of academia as being unscientific.  Even you have to know how stupid of a statement this is.... I hope

You literally bring up mathematical concepts in the next few sentences to emphasize how it helps you form arguments. You're helping to illustrate my point quite effectively honestly, despite acting in complete bad faith. 

&gt;Bringing up the illusory superiority effect doesn't legitimize your argument, brah.

Considering that your behaviors fit the definition, it can definitely help to emphasize my point. 

&gt;I don't think psychology isn't a science because I'm smarter than you - I think it's not a science because it isn't. And there is no consensus. The only people you'll find even discussing this are psychologists seeking to legitimize their mind games.

First off, this is an atrocious interpretation of the dunning kruger effect. You wouldn't think you're correct because you're inherently smarter then your opponent, you would think you're correct because you assess your competence in a subject much higher then it is.

And to the second part of your point, you've failed to substantiate it in any meaningful way. You're just restating the claim over and over. Maybe if you took a few writing classes you'd understand what it means to adequately back up a claim. 

&gt;How am I bizarre for looking at your post history when you literally replied to two of my posts on this thread before I responded to you?

It's bizarre to go through multiple pages of somebody's post history to figure out what their major is. Replying to two of your posts in the same thread is very reasonable behavior. The former is very petty/creepy behavior. Conflating the two is asinine.

&gt;Are you even a CS student? Formal logic is everywhere in CS and programming... Yet the only thing you can connect it to is an ethics of computing class? wat? How about logic operators, conditional statements, loops, etc.?????

All of these mathematical concepts can help you form arguments on a very basic level, but I don't think they really help much in a back and forth format. 

Unless you have issues interpreting very basic conditional statements... I guess... But I don't think basic programming concepts are going to help you any more then an English 101 course would. 

An ethics course is probably the most useful because formulating/defending a moral system at least makes you walk through the basics of making a claim and defending it. That said, ASU's computing ethics course is very lack luster imo so even that isn't that great. 

Discrete math is relevant as the basic proofs and propositional logic in the class can be a good way of understanding the fundamentals of argumentative structure. That's primarily why I listed those two classes.

Arizona,"Not the best place to ask since, shocker, everyone here really only has experience with ASU. As a whole I believe ASU’s engineering school is a better program, but UofA definitely does have majors they excel in. 

 Additionally, everything you listed is encompassed in a CS degree (with options to minor in any of the fields you mentioned). You learn the boring foundations in school, and you have to learn what you are doing once you start work anyway. A CS degree can be hired for any CIS job, the reverse is not True, and starting salaries are a tier lower for CIS until you make it out of an entry position. If you have looked into it and that’s really what you want to do? Go for it! Just some food for thought while you are deciding.",0.2994,0.5057,0.1949

Carey as a whole is very slightly better than Eller, but destroys Eller in a few key areas such as supply chain management and major parts of CIS... for reference, ASU’s MS Business Analytics Program (basically CIS as a masters degree with some more coding and modeling) is ranked #33 in the country, I’m unsure of Arizona’s rating for the program but I believe it’s unranked as the program opened just last year",0.3892,0.502,0.1088
Arizona,"I'm in the CIS program and I'm about to graduate. I already have a job lined up when I graduate and so do most of my peers. I'd say that's a pretty good indication of the program as a whole. 
The first 2 years are a little slow but you get a good understanding of business as a whole (finance, accounting, management, some basic information system understanding). After about 2 years the classes you take are about SQL, HTML, python/C# and those are great and I feel like prepare you pretty well for the business world. Also, ASU's WP Carey School of business (where the CIS program is) is one of the best business schools in the country.
